## 1. Sci-fi as STS
- "hard" science fiction: detailed attention to known science and technology.
- "soft" science fiction: detailed attention to social, psychological, and cultural elements.
- Speculative fiction:
	- Stories whose objective is to explore, to discover, to learn, by means of projection, extrapolation, analogue, hypotheses-and-paper-experimentation.
	- Science fiction is like an experiment. An experiment to try different ideas and topics.
- The book wrote itself according to Le Guin. She saw it as an experiment between two wills and how it would play out.
	- She is putting ideas in a conversation with each other and observing the outcome.
- Sci-fi and STS both work to reveal the way science and society work together.
- ## The powers of sci-fi:
	- It can render dynamics visible that aren't visible to everyone.
	- Sci-fi can talk about things that are hard to talk about.
	- Sci-fi can project the instituions of today into the future.
		- What the future may look like if current instituions continue doing what they are doing.
	- It can imagine new institution.
		- Other possibilities/new ways the future can look.
	- Can challenge the taken-for-grantedness of our ways of life.
	- Can comment more directly on science and technology.
		- How our technologies shape the world around it.
## 2. Sci-fi X STS
- ## Strengths and weeknesses in Sci-fi
	- Is non-empirical
		- Not an actual experiment
	- Lacks explicit theory
	- Lacks peer review
	- But is more accessible and flexible as a format when compared to academic writing.
- Many STS scholars have made use of sci-fi as a tool for imagining how tehnoscience functions, or might function otherwise.
