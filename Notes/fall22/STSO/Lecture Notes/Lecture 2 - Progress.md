> "The *progress* of the age has almost outsripped human belief; the future us known only to Omniscience"
\- Daniel Webster
- The progress that webster describes is more knowledge and ability to do things, but not progress in human rights and a focus on more humanitarian subjects.
	- Led by the forward march of technology.
	- "...improvements in power, efficiency, rationality \[were valued] as end in themselves."
- This view makes instrumental values fundamental to social progress, and relegates what formerly were considered primary, goalsetting values (freedom, justice, etc...) to a secondary status.
	- These new technologies may have made manufactured goods more available, but it had negative impact on labor conditions.
#### Only by Questioning the Assumption that Innovation Represents Progress that We Begin to Judge Its Worth. - Marxx
