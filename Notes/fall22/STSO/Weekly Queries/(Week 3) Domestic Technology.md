Technology has a big part in the way culture evolves in our society, and although the idea is that this change is always a positive one, in reality it can actually be quite harmful to certain groups. A new piece of equipment may be presented as a way to simplify and automate a certain part of life, but what many people fail to acknowledge is the effect this has on the those who were in charge of this task beforehand, often it can create an even wider cultural gap. It seems impossible to create a piece of technology that is beneficial to everyone. But is there a solution to this problem or are we always doomed to affect specific cultures for the sake of innovation?
