In the excerpt from "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", Langdon Winner exams the point of whether or not new technology is inherently political or if politics are just a consequence of progression within a society. He examines points from both side, on one end many of the technology and infrastructure we see today was created with a political meaning, while on the other hand politics need to be involved in order to ensure that our technology functions properly and for the benefit of the people. Although new technology is never used as properly intended, it is almost impossible to foresee the effects of technology on our world. Someone may make something without putting any political intent behind it but then it may be used as that. Is there a right answer to this question? And how can we as a society fix the ways that we view our technology and our leaders?
