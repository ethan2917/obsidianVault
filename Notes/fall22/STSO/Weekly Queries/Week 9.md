In _Lathe of Heaven,_ _Ursula K. Le Guin_ tackles the idea of what would happen if someone was given the ability to change the present and addresses the question of "why not change the world?". Through a series of unfortunate or "fortunate" events depending on which character you would ask, Le Guin describes what would happen if one person was given the power to change the world but also how important it is to be cautious while making change. When striving to make a perfect world it is important to realize that this is an impossible task to achieve without unforeseen consequences, one person cannot solely be in charge of the world, it must be a collective journey. How as a society can we come together to create a world that we all see as perfect?
