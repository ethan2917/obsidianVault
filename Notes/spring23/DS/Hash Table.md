- A table implementation with *constant time access*.
	- Can store elements in a collection like [[STL Sets]].
	- Can store key-value pair associations in the table like [[STL Maps]].

> [!important] Faster to do find, insert, and erase with a hash table, however hash tables *do not* store the data in sorted order.

- Implemented with an array at the top level.
- Each element or key is mapped to a slot in the array by a [[Hash Function.]]
- [[A Set As a Hash Table]]
