- When trying to determine the relationship between class C1 and C2, think of a logical relationship between them that can be written.
	- C1 is a C2 
	- C1 has a C2
	- C1 is implemented as a C2 
- If writing "C1 is-a C2" is best 
	- then C1 should be a derived class 
- If writing "C1 has-a C2" is best 
	- then C1 should have a member variable of type C2
- In the case of "C1 is implemented as-a C2"
