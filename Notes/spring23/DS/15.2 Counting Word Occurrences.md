- Lets see how this works to count the occurrences of each word in a file.
```c++
#include <iostream> 
#include <map> 
#include <string> 
int main() { 
	std::string s; 
	std::map<std::string, int> counters; // store each word and an associated counter 
	// read the input, keeping track of each word and how often we see it 
	while (std::cin >> s) 
		++counters[s]; 
	// write the words and associated counts 
	std::map<std::string, int>::const_iterator it; 
	for (it = counters.begin(); it != counters.end(); ++it) { 
		std::cout << it->first << "\t" << it->second << std::endl; 
	} 
	return 0; 
}
```
