- STL sets are *ordered* containers storing unique *keys*.
	- An ordering relation on the keys, which defaults to `operator<` is necessary.
- Sets are like maps ([[15.0 Associative Containers (Maps), Part 1]]) except they have only have *keys* and no associated values.
- The keys are **constant**.
- Access to items in sets is extremely fast *O(log(n))*, just like maps, but sets do not have the `[]` operator and you shouldn't use `[]` to access elements in a set.
- Sets have the usual constructors as well as the `size` member function.
