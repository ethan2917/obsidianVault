- There is two auxilary classes, `TreeNode` and `tree_iterator`. All three clases are templated.
- The only member variables of the ds_set class are the root and the size.
- The iterator class is declared internally.
	- Note that `operator*` returns a const reference because the keys canâ€™t change.
- The main public member functions just call a private (and often recursive) member function (passing the root node) that does all of the work.
- Because the class stores and manages dynamically allocated memory, a copy constructor, operator=, and destructor must be provided.
