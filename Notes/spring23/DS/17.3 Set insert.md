- There are two different version of the `insert` member function.
- The first version inserts the entry into the set and returns a pair.
	- The first component of the returned pair refers to the location in the set containing the entry.
	- The second component is true if the entry wasn't already in the set. It is false otherwise.
- The second version also inserts the key if it is not already there.
- The iterator `pos` is a *hint* as to where to put it.
	- This makes the insert faster if the hint is good.
```c++
pair<iterator,bool> set<Key>::insert(const Key& entry); 
iterator set<Key>::insert(iterator pos, const Key& entry);
```
