- Used in prioritizing operations.
- Their interface is most similar to a [[Queue]], including a `front` and a `back`.
- Each item is stored in a priority queue using an associated "priority".

	- The `tail` is never accessed through the public interface.
- The main operations are `insert`, and `pop`.
