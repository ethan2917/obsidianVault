## Lecture: 5.0 Pointers and Arrays

## 5.1 Pointer Example
```c++
float x = 15.5;
float *p; /*equiv: float* p; or float * p; */
p = &x;
if (x > 20) {
	cout << "Bigger\n";
} else {
	cout << "Smaller\n";
}
```
- The output is `Bigger` because `x == 72.0`.
> [!question] What is going on?

## 5.2 Pointer Variables and Memory Access
- `x` is an ordinary float, but `p` is a pointer that can hold the memory address of a float variable.
- The value stored in a pointer variable is an address in memory.
	- The statement `p = &x;` takes the address of `x`'s memory location and stores it in the memory location associated with p.
- The statement `*p = 72;` causes the computer to get the memory location stored at `p`, then go to that memory location and store 72 there.
	- x is now 72.
> [!note] `*p` is an l-value.

## 5.3 Defining Pointer Variables
```c++
int * p, q;
float *s,*t;
```
- p, s, and t are all pointer variables, but q is **NOT**.
	- You need the `*` before each variable name.
- You must also initialize pointer variables or else running an example like `*p = 15;` using the two lines above may crash your program.

## 5.4 Operations on Pointers
- The `*` operator in `*p` is the *dereferencing operator*.
	- It means **follow the pointer**.
- The `&` operator in `&x` means **take the memory address of**.
- Pointers can be assigned.
	- This copies the memory addresses as though they were values.
```c++
float x=5, y=9;  
float *p = &x, *q = &y;  
*p = 17.0;  
*q = *p;  
q = p;  
*q = 13.0;
```
| type       | variable   | value |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| float      | x          | 5.0   |
| float      | y          | 9.0   |
| float*     | p          | x     |
| float*     | q          | y     |
| expression | \*p = 17.0 |       |
| expression | \*q = \*p  |       |
| float      | x          | 17.0  |
| float      | y          | 17.0  |
| expression | q = p      |       |
| expression | \*q = 13.0           |       |
| float      | x          | 13.0  |
| float      | y          | 17.0  |

> [!question] What are the values of `x` and `y` at the end?
> > [!todo] x = 13.0 and y = 17.0

- Assignments of integers or floats to pointers and assignmets mixing pointers of different types are illegal. Continuing from above:
```c++
int *r;  
r = q; // Illegal: different pointer types;  
p = 35.1; // Illegal: float assigned to a pointer
```
- Comparisons between pointers of the for `if (p == q)` or ` if ( p != q ) ` are legal and very useful!
	- Less then and greater than comparisons are also allowed.
		- These are useful only when the pointers are to locations within an array.

## 5.5 Exercise
```c++
int x = 10, y = 15;  
int *a = &x;  
cout << x << " " << y << endl;  
int *b = &y;  
*a = x * *b;  
cout << x << " " << y << endl;  
int *c = b;  
*c = 25;  
cout << x << " " << y << endl;
```
| Type | Name | Value |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| int  | x    | 10    |
| int  | y    | 15    |
| int* | a    | x      |
Output: `10 15`

| Type       | Name           | Value |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- |
| int*       | b              | y     |
| expression | \*a = x \* \*b |       |
| int        | x              | 150      |
Output: `150 15`

| Type       | Name     | Value |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- |
| expression | \*c = b  | y     |
| expression | \*c = 25 |       |
| int        | y        | 25      |
Output: `150 25`

## 5.6 Null Pointers
- Like the `int` type, pointers are not default initialized.
- Pointers that don't yet point anywhere useful are often explicitly assigned to `NULL`.
	- `NULL` is equal to the integer 0, which is a legal pointer value.
		- You can store `NULL` in a pointer variable.
	- But `NULL` is not a valid memory location you are allowed to read or write.
		- If you try to dereference or follow a `NULL` pointer, your program will crash.
		- We indicate a `NULL` or `nullptr` value in diagrams with a slash through the memory location box.
> [!note] In C++11, we are encouraged to switch to use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or 0, to avoid some subtle situations where `NULL` is incorrectly seen as an `int` type instead of a pointer. For this course we will assume `NULL` and `nullptr` are equivalent.
- Comparing a pointer to `NULL` is very useful. it can be used to indivate whether or not a pointer variable is pointing at a usable memory location. For example, the following code tests to see if `p` is pointing somewhere that appears to be useful before accessing and printing the value stored at that location.
```c++
if ( p != NULL )  {
	cout << *p << endl;
}

```
- But don't make the mistake of assuming pointers are automatically initialized to `NULL`.

## 5.7 Arrays
- Here's a quick example of how to use an array:
```c++
const int n = 10;  
double a[n];  
int i;  
for ( i=0; i<n; ++i ) {
	a[i] = sqrt( double(i) );
}
```
> [!attention]  The size of an array `a` is fixed at compile time. STL vectors act like arrays, but they can grow and shrink dynamically in response to the demands of the application.

## Stepping through Arrays with Pointers (Array *Iterators*)
- The array code above that uses `[]` *subscripting* can be equivalently rewritten to use pointers:
```c++
const int n = 10;  
double a[n];  
double *p;  
for ( p=a; p<a+n; ++p ) {
	*p = sqrt( p-a );
}
```
- The assignment `p = a` takes the address of the start of the array and assigns it to `p`.
- This illustrates the fact that the name if an array is in fact **a pointer to the start of a block of memory**.
	- We could also write this line as `p = &a[0]` which means *find the location of `a[0]` and take its address*.
- By incrementing `++p`, we make `p` point to the next location in the array.
	- When we increment a pointer we don't just add one byte to the address, we add the number of bites *(sizeof)* used to store on object of the specific type of that pointer.
	- Since the type `p` is `double` and the size of `double` is 8 bytes, we are actually adding 8 bytes to the address when we execute `++p`.
- The test `p<a+n` checks to see if the value of the pointer (the address)  is less than *n* array locations beyond the start of the array.
	- In this example, **a+n** is the memory location 80 bytes after the start of the array (n = 10 slots * 8 bytes per slot).
	- We could equivalently used the test `p != a+n`.
- In the assignment: `*p = sqrt( p-a )`, `p-a` is the number of array locations between p and the start.
	- The square root of this value is assigned to `*p`.
- Here's a picture to explain:
-  ![[5.0 Pointers and Arrays 1.png | 400]]
> [!note] There may or may not be unused memory between your array and other local variables. Similarly the order that your local variables appear on the stack is not guaranteed (the compiler may rearrange things a bit in an attempt to optimize performance or memory usage). A *buffer overflow* (attempting to access an illegal array index) may cause an immediate failure.

## 5.9 Sorting an Array
- Arrays may be sorted using `std::sort`, just like vectors.
	- Pointers are used in place of iterators, for example if `a` is an array of doubles and there are `n` values then use `std::sort( a, a+n );` to sort the values in the array into increasing order.

## 5.10 Exercises
1. Write code to print the array `a` backwards, using pointers.
```c++

```
