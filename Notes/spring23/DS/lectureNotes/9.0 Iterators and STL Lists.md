## Lecture: 9.0 Iterators and STL Lists

## 9.6 Iterators
- An **iterator**:
	- Identifies a container and a specific element stored in the container
	- Lets us examine (and change) the value stored at that element of the container.
	- Provides operations for moving (the iterators) between elements in the container.
	- Restricts the available operations in ways that correspond to what the container can handle efficiently
- Iterators for different container classes have any operations in common.
- Iterators in many ways are generalizations of pointers: many operators/operations defined for pointers are defined for iterators.
- Iterators in many ways are generalizations of pointers: many operators / operations defined for pointers are defined for iterators.

## 9.7 Iterator Declarations and Operations
- Iterator types are declared by the container class. For example,
```c++
vector::iterator p; 
vector::const_iterator q;
```
defines two (uninitialized) iterator variables.
- The *deference operator* is used to access the value stored at an element of the container. The code:
  ```c++
  p = enrolled.begin();
  *p = "012312";
```
changes the first entry in the **enrolled** vector.
- The deference operator is combined with dot operator for accessing the member variables and member functions of elements stored in containers.
- Here's an example using the `Student` class and `students` vector from Lecture 4:
  ```c++
  vector::iterator i = students.begin(); 
  (*i).compute_averages(0.45);
```
> [!note] - This operation would be illegal if `i` had been defined as a `const_iterator` because `compute_averages` is a non-const member function.
> - The parentheses on the `*i` are **required** (because of operator precedence).
- There is a "syntactic sugar" for the combination of the deference operator and the dot operator, which is exactly equivalent:
  ```c++
  vector::iterator i = students.begin(); 
  i->compute_averages(0.45);
```
- Just like pointers, iterators can be incremented and decremented using the `++` and `--` operators to move to the next or previous element of any container.
- Iterators can be compared using the `==` and `!=` operators.
- Iterators can be assigned, just like any other variable.  Vector iterators have several additional operations:
	- Integer values may be added to them or subtracted from them. This leads to statements like `enrolled.erase(enrolled.begin() + 5); `
	- Vector iterators may be compared using operators like `<`, `<=`, etc. 
	- For most containers (other than vectors), these “random access” iterator operations are not legal and therefore prevented by the compiler. The reasons will become clear as we look at their implementations.

## 9.9  A New Datatype: The `list` Standard Library Container Class
- Lists are our second standard-library container class.
- Both lists & vectors store sequential data that can shrink or grow.
- However, the use of memory is fundamentally different.
- Vectors are formed as a single contiguous array-like block of memory.
- Lists are formed as a sequentially linked structure instead.
  - ![[9.0 Iterators and STL Lists.png]]
- Although the interface of lists and vectors and their iterators are quite similar, their implementations are **very** different. Clues to these differences can be seen in the operations that are NOT in common, such as:
	- `STL vectors` / arrays allow "random-access" / indexing / [] subscripting. We can immediately jump to an arbitrary location within the vector / array.
	- `STL lists` have no subscripting operation (we can't use [] to access data). The only way to get to the middle of a list is to follow pointers one link at a time.
	- Lists have `push_front` and `pop_front` functions in addition to the `push_back` and `pop_back` functions of the vector.
	- `erase` and `insert` in the middle of the STL list is very efficient, independent of the size of the list. Both are implemented by rearranging pointers between small blocks of memory.
	- We can't use the same STL sort function we used for vector; we must use a special sort function defined by the STL list type.
	  ```c++
	  std::vector my_vec; 
	  std::list my_lst; 
	  // ... put some data in my_vec & my_lst 
	  std::sort(my_vec.begin(),my_vec.end(),optional_compare_function); 
	  my_lst.sort(optional_compare_function);
```
> [!note] `STL list sort` member function is just as efficient, O(n log n), and will also take the same optional compare function as `STL vector`.
- Several operations invalidate the values of vector iterators, but not list iterators:
	- `erase` invalidates all iterators after the point of erasure in vectors;
	- `push_back` and `resize` invalidate ALL iterators in a vector.
- The value of any associated vector iterator must be re-assigned / re-initialized after these operations.

## 9.11 Erase & Iterators
- STL lists and vectors each have a special member function called `erase`. In particular, given list of ints `s`, consider the example:
  ```c++
  std::list::iterator p = s.begin(); ++p; 
  std::list::iterator q = s.erase(p);
```
- After the code above is executed:
	- The integer stored in the second entry of the list has been removed.
	- The size of the list has shrunk by one.
	- The iterator `p` does not refer to a valid entry.
	- The iterator `q` refers to the item that was the third entry and is now the second.
	- ![[9.0 Iterators and STL Lists-1.png]]
- To reuse the iterator `p` and make it a valid entry, you will often see the code written:
  ```c++
  std::list::iterator p = s.begin(); 
  ++p;
  p = s.erase(p);
```
- Even though the `erase` function has the same syntax for vectors and for list, the vector version is O(n), whereas the list version is O(1).

## 9.12 Insert
- Similarly, there is an `insert` function for STL lists that takes an iterator and a value and adds a link in the chain with the new value immediately before the item pointed to by the iterator.
- The call returns an iterator that points to the newly added element.
- Variants on the basic insert function are also defined.
