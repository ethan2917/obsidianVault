- Functions are used to:
	- Break code into modules for ease of programming and testing, **and for ease of reading.**
	- Create code that is reusable at several places in one program and by several programs.
- Each function has a sequence of parameters and a return type. The function `prototype` below has a return type of `bool` and five parameters.
```c++
bool find_roots(int a, int b, int c, float &root_pos, float &root_neg);
```
- The order and types of the parameters in the calling function (the main function in this example) must match the order and types of the parameters in the function prototype.
