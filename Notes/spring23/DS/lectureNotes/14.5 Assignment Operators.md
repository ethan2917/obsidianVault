- The assignment operator `z1=z2;` becomes a function call `z1.operator=(z.2);`.
	- Cascaded assignments like `z1=z2=z3;` are really `z1=(z2=z3);` which becomes `z1.operator= (z2.operator= (z3));`
- The argument on the right side is passed by constant reference.
	- Its values are used to change the contents of the left size of the operator.
	- A reference to this object is returned, allowing a subsequent call to `operator=` (z1's operator= in the example above).
	- This identifier `this` is reserved as a pointer inside class scope to the object whose member function is called.
		- Therefore, `*this` is a reference to the object.
- The fact `operator=` returns a reference allows us to write code of the form: `(z1=z2).real();`
