> [!question] - Is everything being initialized correctly, including boolean flag variables, accumulation variables, max / min variables?
> - Is the logic of your conditionals correct? Check several times and test examples by hand.

> [!question] - Do you have the bounds on the loops correct? Should you end at n, n−1 or n−2? Tidy up your “notes” to formalize the invariants. 
>> [!todo] - Study the code to make sure that your code does in fact have it right. 
>> - When possible use assertions to test your invariants. (Remember, sometimes checking the invariant is impossible or too costly to be practical.)

> [!question] Does it work on the corner cases; e.g., when the answer is on the start or end of the data, when there are repeated values in the data, or when the data set is very small or very large?
