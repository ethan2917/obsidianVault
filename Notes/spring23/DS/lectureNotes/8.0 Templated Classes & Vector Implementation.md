## Lecture: 8.0 Templated Classes & Vector Implementation

## 8.2 Vector Public Interface
- The STL vector class public interface:
```c++
public: 
// MEMBER FUNCTIONS AND OTHER OPERATORS 
T& operator[] (size_type i); 
const T& operator[] (size_type i) const; 
void push_back(const T& t); 
void resize(size_type n, const T& fill_in_value = T()); 
void clear(); 
bool empty() const; 
size_type size() const;
```

## 8.3 Templated Class Declarations and Member Function Definitions
- In terms of the layout of the code in `vec.h` the biggest difference is that this is a *templated class*.
	- The keyword **template** and the template type name must appear before the class declaration `template <class T> class Vec`
- Within the class declaration, T is used as a type and all member functions are said to be "templated over type T".
	- In the actual text of the code files, templated member functions are defined *inside the class declaration*
- The templated functions defined outside the template class declaration must be preceded by the phrase: `template <class T>` and when `Vec` is referred to it must be as `Vec<T>`.
	- For example, for member function create (two versions), we write: `template <class T> void Vec::create(...`

## 8.4 Syntax and Compilation
- Templated classes and templated member functions are not created/compiled until they are needed.
- Compilation of the class declaration is triggered by a line of the form: `Vec<int> v1;` with `int` replacing `T`.
- This also compiles the default constructor for `Vec<int>` because it is used here. Other member functions are not compiled unless they are used.
- When a different type is used with `Vec`, like in `Vec<double> z;` the template class declaration is compiled again, this time with `double` replacing `T`.
- The templated class declaration and the code for all used member functions must be provided where they are used.
	- As a result, member functions definitions are often included within the class declaration or defined outside but still in the `.h` file.
	- If member function definitions are placed in a separate `.cpp` file, this file must be `#included`, just like the `.h` file.
		- Normally we don't `#include .cpp` files.
> [!note] Including function definitions in the `.h` for ordinary non-templated classes may lead to compilation error about functions being "multiply defined".

## 8.5 Member Variables
- Now, looking inside the `Vec<T>` class at the member variables:
	- `m_data` is a pointer to the start of the array (after allocation).
	- `m_size` indicates the number of locations currently in use in the vector. This is exactly what the `size()` member function should return.
	- `m_alloc` is the total number of slots in the dynamically allocated block of memory.

## 8.6 Typedefs
- Several types are created through `typedef` statements in the first `public` area of `Vec`. Once created the names are used as ordinary type names/
- For example `Vec<int>::size_type` is the return type of the size() function, defined here as an `unsigned int`.

## 8.7 operator[]
- Access to the individual locations of a `Vec` is provided through `operator[]`.
- If v is a `Vec<int>` then:
```c++
v[i] = 5;
// translates into
v.operator[](i) = 5;
```
- In most classes there are two versions of `operator[]`:
	- A non-const version returns a reference to `m_data[i]`. This is applied to non-const `Vec` objects.
	- A const version is the one called for `const Vec` objects. This also returns `m_data[i]`, but as a const reference, so it cannot be modified.

## 8.8 Default Versions of Assignment Operator and Copy Constructor Are Dangerous!
- C++ compilers provide default versions of these if they are not provided.
- These defaults just copy the values of the member variables one-by-one.

## 8.10 Classes With Dynamically Allocated Memory
- For `Vec` (and other classes with dynamically-allocated memory) to work correctly each object must do its own dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
	- We must be careful to keep the memory of each object instance separate from all others.
- All dynamically-allocated memory for an object should be released when the object is finished with it or when the object itself goes out of scope (*destructor*)
- To prevent the creation and use of default versions of these operations, we must write our own:
	- *Copy constructor*
	- *Assignment operator*
	- *Destructor*

## 8.11 The "this" Pointer
- All class objects have a special pointer defined called `this` which simply points to the current class object, and it may not be changed.
- The expression `*this` is a reference to the class object.
- The `this` pointer is used in several ways.
	- Make it clear when member variables of the current object are being used.
	- Check to see when an assignment is self-referencing.
	- Return a reference to the current object.


## 8.12 Copy Constructor
- This constructor must dynamically allocate any memory needed for the object being constructed, copy the contents of the memory of the passed object to this new memory, and set the values of various member variables appropriately.
- In our `Vec` class, the actual copying is done in a private member function called `copy`.

## 8.13 Assignment Operator
- Assignment operators of the form `v1 = v2` are translated by the compiler as `v1.operator=(v2);`.
- Cascaded assignment operators of the form `v1 = v2 = v3` are translated as `v1.operator=(v2.operator=(v3));`.
- Therefore, the value of the assignment operator `=` must be suitable for input to a second assignment operator. This in turn means the result of an assignment operator ought to be a reference to an object.
- The implementation of an assignment operator usually takes on the same form for every class:
	- Do no real work if there is self-assignment.
	- Otherwise, destroy the contents of the current object then copy the passed object, just as done by the copy constructor.
		- In fact, it often makes sense to write a private helper function used by both the copy constructor and the assignment operator.
	- Return a reference to the copied current object, using `this` pointer.

## 8.14 Destructor (the "constructor with a tilde")
- The destructor is called implicitly when an automatically-allocated object goes *out of scope* or a dynamically-allocated object is *deleted*.
- The destructor is responsible for deleting dynamic memory "owned" by the class.
- The ~ has been used as a bit-wise inverse or logic negation in other contexts.

## 8.15 Increasing the Size of the Vec
- `push_back(T const& x)` adds to the end of the array, increasing `m_size` by one `T` location.
> [!question] But what if the allocated array is full (`m_size == m_alloc`)?
> > [!todo] 1. Allocate a new, larger, array. The best strategy is to double the size of the current array.
> > 2. If the array size was 0 we must be sure that the resulting size is at least 1.
> > 3. Then we need to copy the contents of the current array.
> > 4. Finally, we must delete current array, and make the `m_data` pointer point to the start of the new array, and adjust `m_size` and `m_alloc` variables.
- Only when we are sure there is enough room in the array should we actually add the new object to the back of the array.

## 8.18 Vec Declaration & Implementation (vec.h)
```c++
#ifndef Vec_h_
#define Vec_h_

// Simple implementation of the vector class, revised from Koenig and Moo. This 
// class is implemented using a dynamically allocated array (of templated type T). 
// We ensure that that m_size is always <= m_alloc and when a push_back or resize 
// call would violate this condition, the data is copied to a larger array.

template <class T> class Vec{
public:
	//TYPEDEFS
	typedef unsigned int size_type;

	//CONSTRUCTORS, ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR & DESTRUCTOR
	Vec() { this->create();}
	Vec(size_type n, const T& t = T()) { this->create(n, t); } 
	Vec(const Vec& v) { copy(v); } 
	Vec& operator=(const Vec& v); 
	~Vec() { delete [] m_data; }

	//MEMBER FUNCTIONS AND OTHER OPERATORS
	T& operator[] (size_type i) { return m_data[i]; } 
	const T& operator[] (size_type i) const { return m_data[i]; } 
	void push_back(const T& t); 
	void resize(size_type n, const T& fill_in_value = T()); 
	void clear() { delete [] m_data; create(); } 
	bool empty() const { return m_size == 0; } 
	size_type size() const { return m_size; }

private:
	//PRIVATE MEMBER FUNCTIONS
	void create();
	void create(size_type n, const T& val);
	void copy(const Vec<T>& v);

	//REPRESENTATION
	T* m_data; // Pointer to first location in the allocated array
	size_type m_size; // Number of elements stored in the vector
	size_type m_alloc; // Number of array locations allocated, m_size <= m_alloc
};

// Create an empty vector (null pointers everywhere). 
template <class T> void Vec<T>::create() { 
	m_data = NULL;
	m_size = m_alloc = 0; // No memory allocated yet
}

// Create a vector with size n, each location having the given value 
template <class T> void Vec<T>::create(size_type n, const T& val) { 
	m_data = new T[n]; 
	m_size = m_alloc = n; 
	for (size_type i = 0; i < m_size; i++) { m_data[i] = val; } 
}

// Assign one vector to another, avoiding duplicate copying. template 
template <class T> Vec<T>& Vec<T>::operator=(const Vec<T>& v) { 
	if (this != &v) { 
	delete [] m_data; 
	this -> copy(v); 
	} 
	return *this; 
}


// Create the vector as a copy of the given vector. template void 
template <class T> Vec<T>::copy(const Vec<T>& v) {

}

template <class T> void Vec<T>::push_back(const T& val) { 
	if (m_size == m_alloc) { 
	// Allocate a larger array, and copy the old values 
		T* tmp = new T[m_alloc*2];
		for (int i = 0; i<m_alloc; i++){
			tmp[i] = m_data[i];
		}

		m_alloc *= 2;
		delete []m_data;
		m_data = tmp;
	}
	// Add the value at the last location and increment the bound 
	m_data[m_size] = val; 
	++m_size; 
}

// If n is less than or equal to the current size, just change the size. If n is 
// greater than the current size, the new slots must be filled in with the given value. 
// Re-allocation should occur only if necessary. push_back should not be used. 
template void Vec::resize(size_type n, const T& fill_in_value) { 
} 
#endif
