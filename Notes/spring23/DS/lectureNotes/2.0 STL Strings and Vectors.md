- Homework 1 is out and due Thursday (1/19) at 11:59 pm.
- Read through https://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring23/csci1200/programming_information.php while working on the homework.
- TA & Instructor Office Hours: https://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring23/csci1200/schedule.php.

### 2.1 String Concatenation and Creation of Temporary String Objects
```c++
std::string my_line = "*" + std::string(first.size()+2, ' ') + "*";
```
- The above statement creates a new string by concatenating other strings together.
- The expression `std::string(first.size()+@, ' ')` within this statement creates a temporary STL string but does not associate it with a variable.

### 2.2 Character Arrays and String Literals
- In the line below "Hello!" is a *string literal* and it is also an array of character (with no variable name).
```c++
cout << "Hello!" << endl;
```
- A char array can be initialized as:
```c++
char h[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\O'};
# or as
char h[] - "Hello!";
```
- In either case, array h has 7 characters, the last one being the null character (`\O`).
- More about functions for **C-style strings**: https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/

### 2.3 Conversion Between Standard Strings and C-Style String Literals
- We regularly cast between **C-style** & **C++ style (STL)** strings:
```c++
std::string s1("Hello!");
std::string s2(h);
```
- You can obtain the C-style string from a standard string using the member function `c_str`, as in `s1.c_str()`.

### 2.4 L-Values and R-Values
```c++
std::string a = "Kim";
std::string b = "Tom";
a[0] = b[0];
```
- In the code above string a becomes "Tim".
```ad-question
What is the difference between having `a[0]` on the left hand side of the assignment statement and `b[0]` on the right hand side?
```
- The expression `b[0]` gets the char value, `'T'`, from string location 0 in b. This is an **r-value**.
- The expression `a[0]` gets a reference to the memory location associated with string location 0 in a. This is an **l-value**.
- The assignment oerator stores the value in the referenced memory location.
```c++
std::string foo = "hello";  
foo[2] = 'X';  
cout << foo;  
'X' = foo[3];  
cout << foo;
```
>[!question] What's wrong with the above code?
>> [!todo] Your C++ compiler will complain with something like `non-lvalue in assignment`.

### 2.5 Standard Template Library (STL) Vectors: Motivation
> [!attention] Read an unknown number of grades and compute some basic statistics such as the mean (average), standard deviation, median (middle value), and mode (most frequently occurring value).
> > [!todo] Our solution to this problem will be much more robust and less error-prone if we use STL vector class.
> > > [!question] Why would it be more difficult to try to write this using C-style arrays?

### 2.6 STL Vectors: a.k.a "C++ Style", "Smart" Arrays
- Standard library *cointainer class* to hold sequences.
- A vector acts like a dynamically-sized, one-dimensional array (list).
- Capabilities:
	- Holds objects of any type
	- Starts empty unless otherwise specified
	- Any number of objects may be added to the end
		- No size limit
	- It can be treated like an ordinary array using subscripting.
	- A vector knows how many elements it stores.
		- Unlike C arrays
	- There is no automatic checking of subscript bounds.
```c++
// This is how to create an empty vector of integers:
std::vector<int> scores;
```
- Vectors are an example of *templated container class*.
	- The angle brackets < > are used to specify the type of object (the *template type*) that will be stored in the vector.
- `push_back` is a vector function to append a value to the end of the vector.
- `size` is a function defined by the vector type that returns the number of items stored.
- After vectors are initialized they ay be treated just like *arrays*.
	- In the line `sum += scores[i];`, `scores[i]` is an **r-value**, accessing the value stored at location `i` of the vector.
	- We could also write statements like `scores[4] = 100;` to change a score. `scores[4]` is an **l-value**, providing the means of storing 100 at location 4 of the vector.

### 2.7 Initializing a Vector - The Use of Constructors
```c++
/* This constructs an empty vector of integers. Values must be placed in the
vector using push_back */
std::vector<int> a;

/* This constructs a vector of 100 doubles, each entry storing the value 3.14. New entries can be created using push_back but these will create entries 100, 101, 102, etc. */
int n = 100;
std::vector<double> b(100, 3.14);

/* This constructs a vector of 10,000 ints, but provides no initial values for these integers. New entries can be created using push_back but these will create entries 10000, 10001, etc. */
std::vector<int> c(n*n);

// This constructs a vector that is an exact copy of vector b
std::vector<double> d(b)

/* This is a compiler error because no constructor exists to create an int vector from a double vector */
std::vector<int> e(b)
```

### 2.8 Exercises
> [!question] After the above code constructing the three vectors, what will be output by the following statement? `cout << a.size() << endl << b.size() << endl << c.size() << endl;`
> > [!todo] The output will be: `0 100 10000`

> [!question] Write code to construct a vector containing 100 doubles, each habing the value 55.5.
> > [!todo] `std::vector<double> x(100, 55.5)`

> [!question] Write code to construct a vector containing 1000 doubles containing the values 0, 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(3), sqrt(4), sqrt(5), etc. Write it two ways, one that uses `push_back` and one that does not use `push_back`.
```c++
// First way


// Second way

```

### 2.9 Example: Using Vectors to Compute Standard Deviation.
```c++
// Compute the average and standard deviation of an input set of grades.  
#include <fstream>  
#include <iomanip>  
#include <iostream>  
#include <vector> // to access the STL vector class  
#include <cmath> // to use standard math library and sqrt  

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {  
std::cout << argv[0] << std::endl;  
	if (argc != 2) {  
		std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " grades-file\n";  
		return 1;  
	}  
	std::ifstream grades_str(argv[1]);  
	if (!grades_str.good()) {  
		std::cerr << "Can not open the grades file " << argv[1] << "\n";  
		return 1;  
	}  
	std::vector<int> scores; // Vector to hold the input scores; initially empty.  
	int x; // Input variable  
	
	// Read the scores, appending each to the end of the vector  
	while (grades_str >> x) { scores.push_back(x); }  
	
	// Quit with an error message if too few scores.  
	if (scores.size() == 0) {  
		std::cout << "No scores entered. Please try again!" << std::endl;  
		return 1; // program exits with error code = 1  
	}  
	
	// Compute and output the average value.  
	int sum = 0;  
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < scores.size(); ++ i) {  
		sum += scores[i];  
	}  
	double average = double(sum) / scores.size();  
	std::cout << "The average of " << scores.size() << " grades is "  
	<< std::setprecision(3) << average << std::endl;  
	
	// Exercise: compute and output the standard deviation.  
	double sum_sq_diff = 0.0;  
	for (unsigned int i=0; i<scores.size(); ++i) {  
		double diff = scores[i] - average;  
		sum_sq_diff += diff*diff;  
	}  
	double std_dev = sqrt(sum_sq_diff / (scores.size()-1));  
	std::cout << "The standard_deviation of " << scores.size()  << " grades is " << std::setprecision(3) << std_dev << std::endl;  
	
	return 0; // everything ok  
}
```

### 2.10 Standard Library Sort Function
- The prototypes for these algorithms are in header file `algorithm`.
- One of the most important of the algorithms is `sort`.
- It is accessed by provideing the beginning and end of the containers interval to sort.
- The following code reads, sorts, and outputs a vector of doubles:
```c++
double x;
std::vector<double> a;
while (std::cin >> x)
	a.push_back(x);
std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
for (unsigned int i=0; i < a.size(); ++i)
	std::cout << a[i] << '\n';
```
- `a.begin()` is an *iterator* referencing the first location in the vector, while `a.end()` is an *iterator* referencing one past the last location in the vector.
	- Every container has iterators: strings have `begin()` and `end()` iteerators defined on them.
- The ordering of values by `std::sort` is least to greatest. We will see ways to change this.

### 2.11 Example: Computing the Median
```c++
// Compute the median value of an input set of grades.  
#include <algorithm>  
#include <cmath>  
#include <fstream>  
#include <iomanip>  
#include <iostream>  
#include <vector>  

void read_scores(std::vector<int> & scores, std::ifstream & grade_str) {  
	int x; // input variable  
	while (grade_str >> x) {  
		scores.push_back(x);  
	}  
}  
void compute_avg_and_std_dev(const std::vector<int>& s, double & avg, double & std_dev) {  
	// Compute and output the average value.  
	int sum=0;  
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++ i) {  
		sum += s[i];  
	}  
	avg = double(sum) / s.size();  
	// Compute the standard deviation  
	double sum_sq = 0.0;  
	for (unsigned int i=0; i < s.size(); ++i) {  
		sum_sq += (s[i]-avg) * (s[i]-avg);  
	}  
	std_dev = sqrt(sum_sq / (s.size()-1));  
}  
double compute_median(const std::vector<int> & scores) {  
	// Create a copy of the vector  
	std::vector<int> scores_to_sort(scores);  
	// Sort the values in the vector. By default this is increasing order.  
	5
	std::sort(scores_to_sort.begin(), scores_to_sort.end());  
	// Now, compute and output the median.  
	unsigned int n = scores_to_sort.size();  
	if (n%2 == 0) // even number of scores  
		return double(scores_to_sort[n/2] + scores_to_sort[n/2-1]) / 2.0;  
	else  
		return double(scores_to_sort[ n/2 ]); // same as (n-1)/2 because n is odd  
}  
	int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {  
	if (argc != 2) {  
		std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " grades-file\n";  
		return 1;  
	}  
	std::ifstream grades_str(argv[1]);  
	if (!grades_str) {  
		std::cerr << "Can not open the grades file " << argv[1] << "\n";  
		return 1;  
	}  
	std::vector<int> scores; // Vector to hold the input scores; initially empty.  
	read_scores(scores, grades_str); // Read the scores, as before  
	// Quit with an error message if too few scores.  
	if (scores.size() == 0) {  
		std::cout << "No scores entered. Please try again!" << std::endl;  
		return 1;  
	}  
	// Compute the average, standard deviation and median  
	double average, std_dev;  
	compute_avg_and_std_dev(scores, average, std_dev);  
	double median = compute_median(scores);  
	// Output  
	std::cout << "Among " << scores.size() << " grades: \n"  
	<< " average = " << std::setprecision(3) << average << '\n'  
	<< " std_dev = " << std_dev << '\n'  
	<< " median = " << median << std::endl;  
	return 0;
}
```

### 2.12 Passing Vectors (and Strings) As Parameters
- If your are passing a vector as a parameter to a function and you want to make a permanent change to the vector then you should pass it **by reference**.
	-  This is illustrated by the function `read_scores` above.
> [!question] What if you don't want to make changes to the vector or don't want these changes to be permanent?
> > [!todo] The answer we've learned so far is to pass by value.
- The solution is to pass by **constant reference**: pass it by reference, but make it a constant so that it can not be changed.
- As a general rule, you should not pass a container object, such as a vector or string, by value because of the cost of copying.
