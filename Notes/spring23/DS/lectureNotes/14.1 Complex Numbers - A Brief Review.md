- Complex numbers take the form $$z=a+bi$$ , where $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$ and a and b are real.
	- a is called the real part, b is called the imaginary part.
- If w = c + di, then
	- $$-w+z = (a+c) + (b-d)i$$
	- $$- w-z = (a-c) + (b-d)i$$
	- $$-w\times z=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i$$
- The magnitude of a complex number is $$\sqrt{a^{2}+b{2}}$$
