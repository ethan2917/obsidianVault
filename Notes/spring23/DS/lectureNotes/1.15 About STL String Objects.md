- When an object is created a *constructor* is run to initialize the object:
	- To create an empty string `std::string my_string_var;`
	- With a specified number of instances of a single char `std::string my_string_var2(10, ' ');`
	- From another string `std::string my_string_var3(my_string_var2);`
- `my_string_var.size()` is a call to a function size that is defined as a member function of the string class.
	- There is an equivalent function called length.
