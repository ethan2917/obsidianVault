```c++
root_pos = (-b + sqrt_radical) / float(2*a);
```
- The calculation on the right hand side of the = is an expression.
- The value of this expression is assigned to a memory location of the float variable root_pos.
	- If all expression values are type `int` we need a *cast* from `int` to `float` to prevent truncation of int division.
