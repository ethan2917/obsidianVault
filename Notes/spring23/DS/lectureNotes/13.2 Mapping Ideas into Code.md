> [!question] How are you going to represent the data? What is most efficient and what is the easiest?

> [!question] Can you use classes to organize the data? What data should be stored and manipulated as a unit? What information needs to be stored for each object? What operations might be helpfule?

> [!question] How can you divide the problem into units of logic that will become functions? Can you reuse any code you’re previously written? Will any of the logic you write now be re-usable?

> [!question] Are you going to use recursion or iteration? What information do you need to maintain during the loops or recursive calls and how is it being “carried along”?

> [!question] How effective is your solution? Is your solution general? How is the performance? (What is the order notation of the number of operations)? Can you now think of better ideas or approaches?

> [!hint] Make notes for yourself about the logic of your code as you write it. These will become your invariants; that is, what should be true at the beginning and end of each iteration / recursive call.
