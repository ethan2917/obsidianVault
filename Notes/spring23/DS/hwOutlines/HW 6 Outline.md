## To-Do



## Buggy

- [x] Check what direction the word fits in ✅ 2023-03-17
- [x] When asked to find one solution, your program should just output the first legal solution it finds. If impossible print "No solutions found".
- [x] Once you have finished your implementation and testing, analyze the performance of your algorithm using order notation. ✅ 2023-03-17
- [x] What important variables control the complexity of a particular problem? The width & height of the grid (w and h), the number of required words (r), the number of forbidden words (f), the number of letters in each word (l), the number of solutions (s)? In your plain text README.txt, write a concise paragraph (< 200 words) justifying your answer. ✅ 2023-03-17
- [x] Also include a simple table summarizing the<br>running time and number of solutions found by your program on each of the provided examples. ✅ 2023-03-17


## Complete

- [x] First line of file specifies width & height, `+` means the word must appear in the grid, `-` means the word must not appear in the grid. ✅ 2023-03-13
- [x] Expect three command line arguments: input file, output file, and a string ✅ 2023-03-13
- [x] Check if there are no more positive words and the board is full ✅ 2023-03-15
- [x] When asked to find all solutions, the program must output the number of solutions and then ASCII representation for each solution. ✅ 2023-03-15
- [x] We must use recursion in the search. ✅ 2023-03-15
