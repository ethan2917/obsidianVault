> [!question] Why is Descartes inclined to question all of his beliefs to see if they rest on firm foundations or not?

- This might seem to us to be a bit excessive. 
- Yet Descartes was not alone in this.
- Such questioning of things that had been taken to be knowledge for centuries was "in the air" at that time.
	- For example, in England, Francis Bacon also advocated strongly for questioning the old authorities, seeking new knowledge through observation and starting fresh in many areas of inquiry.

- Aristotle and Ptolemy had taught that the Earth was stationary and located at the center of the cosmos, with the sun and planets going around the Earth in preordained spheres.
- And the Ancients appeared not to have known anything about the existence of the New World, or in fact of any continents other than Europe, Asia, and Africa.
