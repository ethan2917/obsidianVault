### Study Questions

> [!question] Can you think what is false?
> > [!todo] Yes, you may believe that a certain idea is false although, it may turn out to be true in the end that does not mean you were not allowed to believe it is false.

> [!question] Can you know what is false?
> > [!todo] Yes, if something is proved false then you know it is false and not true as a fact.

> [!question] Explain the distinction between knowing and seeming to know.
> > [!todo] We may believe that something is true for a fact, although it may be proved to be otherwise later. This is the key difference between the two. We may believe something is one way but once it is revealed that our belief is false we recognize its falsity and we have to retract the claim that it was ever known and only that we once believed it was true.

> [!question] If some of your beliefs turned out to be false, would you care, and if so why?
> > [!todo] Yes, I would care. I would be forced to know believe in a different fact and change  my beliefs due to my newfound falsity. My world view would be forced to adapt.
