## Chapter: Caring and Epistemic Demands

### Terms
- Conscientious (kon-shee-en-shuhs) - controlled by or done according to one's inner sense of what is right.
- Epistemic - of or relating to knowledge or the conditions for acquiring it.

### Study Questions

> [!question] According to Zagzebski, in what two ways does caring impose a demand for conscientious belief?
> > [!todo] Caring imposes a demand as there is a demand to be conscientious in our beliefs and that second, there is a demand to acquire these conscientious beliefs.

> [!question] What does Zagzebski mean by "a community of epistemic trust"?
> > [!todo] A community where they believe each others beliefs and statements. Cassandra was isolated from her "community of epistemic trust" as she was cursed to never be believed.

> [!question] What lesson does Zagzebski draw from the legend of Cassandra?
> > [!todo] We need trust to carry on with practical life within our communities, without trust we could not do the minimum to carry on with practical life.

> [!question] If some of your beliefes turned out to be false, would you care, and, if so, why?
> > [!todo] If a few of my beliefs were revealed as false I believe I would care. I would question the very nature of what I believe is right. I would second guess my other current and future beliefs.
