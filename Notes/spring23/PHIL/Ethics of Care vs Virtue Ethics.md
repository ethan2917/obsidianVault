- Aristotle focused on:
1. Identifying the virtues
2. Fostering their development within oneself and those around one.

- Ethics of Care assigns primary moral value to ***fostering connectedness between people***.
	- Particular personal relationships take on central importance.
- One thing this *does* share with virtue ethics is an emphasis on forming the right emotional reactions.
