> [!question] If there is one God, who is all-powerful and all-good, then how and why does evil exist in the world?

- This is often regarded as the most serious challenge to the existence of God, or at least to the existence of a God who is all-powerful and all-good.
	- If God is omnipotent, He would be able to stop/prevent evil.
	- And if God is all-good, it would seem that He would want to prevent evil. 
		- And yet evil exists all over the place.
- Natural Evils and Moral Evils
- Attempted answers to the Problem of Evil are referred to as [[Theodicies]]
