## Lecture: Three Questions of Ethics

## Announcements
- Study sheet for exam is up

## What is Ethics?
- Ethics is the systematic, organized study of right and wrong, good and bad, and of theories concerning of these things.
### The Three Questions
> [!question] How should one act?
1. The focus here is on how to determine whether a particular action/decision would be morally good or bad.
2. The first two approaches to ethics we will consider, **Utilitarianism** and **Kant's duty-based ethics**, each claim to provide a systematic test for determining whether an action is right or wrong.
> [!question] How should one live?
1. In a certain respect, this is the sum of all one's individual actions.
2. But also involves the goals that guide one's life, what one finds important.
> [!question] What sort of person should one become?
1. This is about the character traits that one develops.
2. Focus is on cultivating virtues and avoiding vices.
3. How one should live and what sort of person to become are focus of *Virtue Ethics* and *Ethics of Care*.
### Socrates' question: How ought we to live?
- Socrates said that he has always exhorted people to concern themselves with how best to live, rather than with personal safety, wealth, or reputation.
- He goes on to say that this is the single more important question a person could ask.

## The Inevitability of Making Ethical Decisions
- One may often think of ethics in terms of the sort of issues that appear in the news or in the context of discussions of historical atrocities.
	- Those are *real ethical issues*.
- But we also encounter ethical decisions in our *everyday lives*.
	- Do I take the time to help or not?
	- How do I use my leisure time?
	- Should I tell someone a lie if I think it's in their best interest?
	- Etc.

## Purely Descriptive Ethics
- One would be engaging in purely descriptive ethics if they describe how people actually think and behave in relation to moral situations but *refrain* from making any judgment as to whether they *should* think and behave in those ways.
	- Few people have aimed to practice purely descriptive ethics.
- All of the philosophical approaches to ethics that we will consider set out to give us grounds for making judgements about whether behaviors are good or bad.
	- They are thus *not* purely descriptive but rather **normative**.

## Normative Ethics
- In contrast to purely descriptive ethics, philosophers are concerned with what people *should* think about moral matters and how they *should* act.
	- In other words, they are concerned with what is **normative**: what the norms and standards *should* be.
- Normative ethics are **prescriptive**.
	- Just as a physician may prescribe medicine or therapy, one who engages in normative ethics is prescribing a criterion for determining the right way to behave.
