- Descartes says that his senses have deceives him at least some of the time.
	- He - and all of us - are susceptible to optical illusions.
		- There are whole books of such illusions.
		- We know that a stick looks bent in water event though it is not actually bent.

> [!important] Descartes remarks that it is probably prudent never to completely trust someone who you know has lied to you in the past, and since our senses have lied to us in the form of optical illusions we should not fully trust them for that reason.
> > [!seealso] But one might respond that sensory illusions are things that happen only in rare instances and that our senses should still be regarded as generally reliable sources of information about the world.

> [!question] Perhaps we just need to be mindful of sensory illusions when they happen and use our reason to work around them and not be deceived?

- But then Descartes questions how we can be sure that our perceptions deceive us only on rare occasions.
	- Specifically, he asks us how we know that we are not **dreaming** right now.
		- Perhaps I am lying in bed asleep right now and everything that I seem to be perceiving through my vision and other senses is really a dream and not at all an accurate picture of the world around me.
