- Imagine a piece of wax removed from a bee hive.
- It has the scent of flowers, it is solid, opaque, at about room temperature, and makes a sound if one strikes it against something else.
- Imagine melting the piece of wax.
	- It becomes a pool of hot liquid, loses the scent of flowers, and is very hot to the touch.
> [!summary] - Even after the wax has undergone all of these changes in the process of melting, we still recognize it is the same wax.
> - Descartes thinks that none of these sensory features are essential to what the wax is.
> - It is not our senses that are telling us it is still the same wax even after all of these changes.
> - It must be the mind that allow us to intuit that it is still the same wax.
> - It's not that the mind is infallible, but the point is that the mind has powers to discern things that go beyond a mere processing of what the senses take in.

> [!question] Does the Wax Example Suggest Anything about the Nature of Material Things?
> > [!check] - If changes in the color, solidity, scent, texture, temperature, etc., did not alter the fact of the wax's continued existence over the temporal sequence of those changes, then we need to ask what features of the wax did not change throughout the process.
> > - The wax continues to have spatial location, the shape may change but the wax is never without location or extension in space at any given moment.
> > - Descartes sometimes refers to the distinction as "res cogitans" vs. "res extensa" - thinking stuff vs. extended stuff.
