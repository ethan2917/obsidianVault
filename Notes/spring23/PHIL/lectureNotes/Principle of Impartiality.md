- This is the idea that each person's interests should count equally when designing and/or applying an ethical theory.
- This may take different forms in different ethical theories.
	- For example, if an ethical theory sets out to maximize happiness, then the Principle of Impartiality would dictate that each personâ€™s happiness count equally in the theory.
	- If, on the other hand, the ethical theory is based on duty, then the Principle of Impartiality will provide that everyone has the same fundamental moral duties.
> [!question] How far should impartiality be taken?

- This leads into a criticism of the Principle of Impartiality, and this indirectly of all moral theories that rely upon this principle.
- Critics have pointed out that, given human psychology and our nature as social beings, impartiality applied all the time would destroy or render impossible most normal human relationships.
	- The relationships of spouses, parents and their children, friendships, etc., all involve spending more time and attention on the other person than on random persons one encounters or mere acquaintances. 
	- If one was completely impartial, one would have to expend as much emotional energy on strangers as on family members, for example.

> [!attention] In reality, most people have the opposite problem: They tend not to be impartial enough. To the extent this is true, impartiality in ethics can be a good corrective to this tendency.
