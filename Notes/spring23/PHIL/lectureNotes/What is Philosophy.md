## Lecture: (1) What is Philosophy

## Aristotle Said that "Philosophy Begins in wonder.".
- Why is philosophy necessary individually or in society? If you don't have wonder you're not going to focus on the deeper questions and aspects of things.
- If there is no wonder or room for inquiry then something is wrong with society.
- Philosophy began around 2600 years ago.
- People always wondered, they looked at the stars and question their significance.

### What Does the Word "philosophy" Mean?
- It comes from philos ("loving") + sophia ("wisdom"). Philosophy literally means "love of wisdom".

### Metaphysics
- It will ask why, look for reasoning behind things.
- The part of physics that asks about the nature of reality. What is most fundamental in the world.
- For example, is time real, does god exist, do numbers exist, etc...
	- Is there more to reality than physical appearances.
	- Taking things past their surface value.
- Metaphysics is most closely connected to science.

### Sub-fields of Philosophy
- Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge)
	- What is knowledge?
	- Is knowledge even possible?
	- How does knowledge differ from true belief?
- Ethics
	- Asks what values we should have and what principles or standards should we use to judge right from wrong?
- Aesthetics
	- Asks whether beauty is simply a matter of taste or whether there might be some objective standards.
	- What makes something a work of art, and what standards should be used to evaluate art?

### When Did Philosophy Begin?
- Philosophy began in the West with the Pre-Socratic Philosophers.
- It began close to what is current day Turkey.
- They wondered why is there order and not chaos. What holds everything together?
- They each had a different theory about the fundamental nature of reality, but they were all seeking to identify and understand the arche, that which originated sustains the cosmos.
- Pythagoras is the most well known pre-socratic philosopher.
	- He had a cult following.
	- Came up with the idea that mathematical relations are what govern the cosmos.
		- This idea originated when he realized the length of a string on an instrument changed the sound that the instrument made.
	- Mathematical ratios and relations are what is most real within the universe.
- Although physical objects will not be here, the idea and facts of math will still be here.
- There are no definite answers in philosophy, once they discovered what made planets move their course it was no longer philosophy and now considered physics.
	- Once a definite answer is found it is no longer a part of philosophy.

### Socrates
- Socrates focused on human beings and society.
	- How we should live and act, what we owe to society and other people, and what sort of education is best.
- There were different forms of government around this time.
- Democracy existed although it fell short at times.
- Socrates always searched for new knowledge of the good and the true.
- He operated under the assumption that there were objective truths and that knowledge of them was in principle possible for human beings.
- During his conversations with people, Socrates would always embarrass people considered as experts.
