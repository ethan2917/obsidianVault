## Lecture: (2) Basics of Arguments

## Notes:
### Two Parts of Any Argument
- Premises
	- Statements
	- Declarative sentences
	- Can be any number of premises
	- Each premises offers more and more support for the conclusion and can be used without one another
	- Premises may even build upon each other
	- The reasons or evidence given in support of the conclusion
- Conclusion
	- The conclusion does not have to be at the end
	- The overall idea
	- Uses premises as evidence/support
- A key part of any argument is to ensure both parties agree on certain terms and what they mean.

### Two Questions to Ask About Any Argument
1. Do the premises support the conclusion?
2. Are the premises in fact true?
- An argument may be such that the premises would support the conclusion *if they were true,* but in fact one or more of the premises is not true.

### Deductive Arguments
- The premises within a deductive argument build upon each other.
- Purport to be "airtight" arguments in which the truth of the premises would guarantee the truth of the conclusion.
- Classical example of deductive argument:
	- P1: All men are mortal
	- P2: Socrates is a man
	- Conc: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
- This is known as a **valid** argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion has to be true.
	- Validity is a claim about the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
	- The premises and the conclusion are not themselves said to be valid.
		- Validity is a property of the argument as a whole.
- If the premises are not all true, then the argument is not a good argument.
- If the premises are about a technical or highly specific subject matter, one may need to consult experts in the particular field in question.
- Some premises are such that their truth or falsity is debated even among conscientious and intelligent people.

### Non-Deductive Arguments
- One very important type of Non-Deductive argument is the **Inductive Argument**.
- These are probabilistic arguments.
	- The conclusion is never 100% certain.
- In the stringest inductive areguments, the conclusion is *nearly* certain, while in many other inductive arguments the conclusion is merely more probable than not.
- A deductive argument is only as good as the inductive arguments behind it.
#### Inductive Arguments
- Argument starts with some finite set of past or current instances and then argues to the conclusion tat something is generally the case (**Inductive Generalization**).
	- Or that the next instance observed will probably be a certain way (**Inductive Analogical Arguments**)
- Again, there is never 100% certainty with inductive arguments of either sort, becausethere is always principle the possibility that negative instances could arise.
##### Relation Between Deduction and Induction
- Note that the premises of deductive arguments are often themselves conclusions of induction.
- Consider our earlier example of deduction:
	- All men are mortal.
	- Socrates is a man,
	- Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
- The premise that all men are mortal is itself a product of **inductive generalization** from all known instances of people who have lived in the past.
### Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE)
- One never achieves 100% certainty with IBE.
- The goal in IBE is to come up with an account that explains and ties together all of the observed evidence/data.
- IBE is usually the type of reasoning employed to solve crimes in detective fiction.
	- It is also used in other contexts, such as in propese explanations of human behavior, historical analyses of events, etc.
		- An archaeologist is investigating the dissapearence of a society by looking through the dig sites to find any type of evidence to point to some sort of conclusion.
	- If a new piece of evidence is found it may dispute the original conclusion.
- If there are two or more possible explanations that cover some of your data but one explanation that covers all of your data it is more likely that the single explanation is correct.

#### Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
- This is not a type of argument but does play a role within arguments.
- To say that A is necessary for B is to say that without A there can be no occurrence of B.
	- Although there is often more than one necessary condition for an event to occur.
		- Oxygen, fuel to burnn, and a source of ignition are each necessary for a fire. But none is sufficient by themselves to guarantee that there will be a fire, but we can say that without any one of these there would be no fire.
- It is sometimes the case that A is both necessary and sufficient for B, but often this is not the case.
- When philosophers ask about what constitutes a mind or what confers personal identity on an individual, they are often looking for something that is both necessary and sufficient.
