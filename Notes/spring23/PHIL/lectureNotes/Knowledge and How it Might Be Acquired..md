## Lecture: Knowledge and How it Might Be Acquired.

## Caring and Epistemic Demands
### Conscientiously Held Belief
> [!quote] If we care about a topic or field of interest, then we should care about having true beliefs in that domain. - Zagzebski (p. 65)

> [!quote] I'll call a belief that is governed by a concern for truth a conscientiously held belief. - Zagzebski (p. 65)
- Zagzebski suggests that we should "commit ourselves to conscientiously getting beliefs about those thinds we cae about," and that not doing so typically weakens our caring.
> [!question] Do you agree with this? Any examples either to support or to challenge the claim that not committing ourselves to cocientiously getting beliefs tends to weaken our caring?
- Zagzebski continues: "And if we need to care about many things to have a good life, the limitations of our ability to form beliefs conscientiously limit the desirability of our lives."
> [!question] Again, what do you think about this? Any examples to either support or challenge the statement?
- Zagzevski aregues that it's not enough to examine conscientiously the beliefs we already have within a domain that we care about, but that we also should seek to conscientiously acquire new beliefs within that domain.
- She continues: "We want beliefs that can serves as the ground of action, and that requires not only true beliefs, but confidece that the particular beliefs we are acting upon are true.".

### Importance of Converying True Beliefs to Other
> [!quote] Among the things we care about is caring that others care about what we care about, which means that we care about their having true beliefs about what we care about...
> > [!question] How to interpret this quote?

> [!quote] So we care about being good informants to to others. We want the ability to convey true beliefs and not false beliefs to others.

### Does Not Guarantee True Beliefs
- Zagzebski points out that being conscientious *does not guarantee* that we willd end up with all and only true beliefs within a domain that we care about.
- She also points out that we depend on other people for most of our beliefs, and we must trust (usually without proof) that they are conscientious in their belief formation.
	- Why? Because "if i don't trust them, I will have fewer beliefs about what I care about and that will give me a less desirable life.".
> [!question] Any examples to back this up?

> [!question] What would happen if nobody was willing to form beliefs based on what other people said?
> > [!todo] Zagzebski suggests that "every attempt at communication would be futile, so there would be no point in trying to talk with anybody about anything."

## Knowing vs. Thinking
> [!question]  How does knowing that something is the case differ from merely thinking it is the case?

> [!question] Knowledge is linked to the truth, but how exactly?

- Nagel's example of Jill and Bill
> [!quote] Jill knows that the door is locked. Bill thinks that the door is locked.
- Jill's door mst be locked for the sentence about her to be true, but Bill's door need not be locked for the sentence about him to be true.
> [!quote] This feature of 'knowing that' is called factivity: we can know only facts, or true propositions

> [!quote] Of course, it's possible to seem to know something that later turns out to be false..
- Having a true belief is a necessary condition for having knowledge, but it's not a sufficient condition.
	- That's because there are other necessary conditions as well.
- Another necessary condition is confidence.
	- One must be sure one's belief is true in order to have knowledge.
	- If one

### Puzzling Out Knowledge
#### Just One Example
- Meteorite discovered in Antarctica, that is believed to be a piece of rock blown into space from Mars. Contains what look to some scientists like fossilized bacterial droppings.
> [!question]  Is this evidence of microbial life on Mars, or isn't it?

> [!quote]
