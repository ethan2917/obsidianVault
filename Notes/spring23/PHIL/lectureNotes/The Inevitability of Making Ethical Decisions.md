- One may often think of ethics in terms of the sort of issues that appear in the news or in the context of discussions of historical atrocities.
	- Those are *real ethical issues*.
- But we also encounter ethical decisions in our *everyday lives*.
	- Do I take the time to help or not?
	- How do I use my leisure time?
	- Should I tell someone a lie if I think it's in their best interest?
	- Etc.
