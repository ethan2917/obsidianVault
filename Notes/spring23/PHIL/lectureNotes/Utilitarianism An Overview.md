## Lecture: Utilitarianism An Overview

## Consequentialism
- **Consequentialism** is a term that covers any ethical theory or approach that looks first and foremost at the actual or the expected consequences of actions or policies.
- Consequentialists generally identify some type of goal or outcome as the greatest good and then evaluate actions, decisions, or policies based on how well they have brough about or are likely to bring about that goal or outcome.
- Historically, consequentialists have usually identified the highest good in terms of happiness, pleasure, or preference satisfaction.
	- But it could in principle also be identified with intellectual or aesthetic experiences, health, honor, or perhaps other things.
- A consequentialist whose goal is to maximize their own long-term overall pleasure or happiness is referred to as **Egoist**.
	- But many philosophers do not consider egoism to be an ethical theory at all, but rather that against which all ethical theories are opposed.
### Utilitarianism as a Type of Consequentialism:
- Utilitarianism is the single largest subcategory of Consequentialism.
- Unlike egoists, whose sole goal is to bring about the pleasure or happiness for themselves, Utilitarians look at the *utility of everyone who will be affected* by a proposed action or policy.
- **Utility** is a general term that is usually fleshed out as pleasure, happiness, or preference satisfaction by particular Utilitarians.
- The original *classical* utilitarianism aims to maximize the overall sum of utility in society.
- A slightly different version might aim to maximize overall utility to the extent that this is compatible with each person in the society being guaranteed at least a certain basic amount of utility.
	- This would in effect rule out outcomes in which overall utility is maximized by having some people receive a large amount of utility while other people receive little or none.
### Utilitarianism was founded by Jeremy Bentham
- A British philosopher who was mainly concerned with the reform of the legal and social systems to make them more impartial and more equitable.

## Principle of Utility
- The central principle of Bentham's theory is what he called the **Principle of Utility**.
- **Principle of Utility**: The right action or policy is whatever one will maximize the overall sum of utility, taking into account equally each person who will be affected by the action.
- Bentham equates utility with pleasure.
- In addition to being called *Classical Utilitarianism*, Bentham's theory is also classified as **Act Utilitarianism**, meaning that the right act is whichever one will maximize utility in a given situation.
	- Act Utilitarianism requires that one do a fresh *mental calculation* each time they are faced with an ethical decision.
		- A calculation as to which course of action is likely to maximize pleasure in that given instance.
### Bentham accepted both Psychological Hedonism and Ethical Hedonism
- The first says that all human beings are *ultimately motivated by pleasure and the avoidance of pain*.
- The second says that we *should be* motivated by these things.
