- When a **somatic cell (non reproductive)** divides the full diploid complement of chromosomes must is passed on to the daughter cells.
- This is accomplished through a complex process of **chromosome duplication** and allocation called **mitosis**.
- **Mitosis** is followed by **cytokinesis** which divides the cytoplasm, organelles & cell membrane equally into **two daughter cells**.
