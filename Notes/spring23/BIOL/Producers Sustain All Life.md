- **No transfer of energy is 100% efficient**
	- Some is always lost as heat, increasing the entropy of the surroundings
- Because of the *Laws of Thermodynamics*, the ongoing existence of the entire biosphere depends on a flow of energy from [[Producers]] to [[Consumers]].
- The chemical energy that plants produce using sunlight is the source of energy that sustains all life within the Earth's ecosystems.
