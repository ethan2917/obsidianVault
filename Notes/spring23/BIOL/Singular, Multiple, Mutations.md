- Most **eukaryotic genes** have intervening sequences of nucleotides within the message that they carry,
	- This makes no sense in terms of reading the information.
- Extracting the meaning requires precision.
- The **transcript** of these genes **must be processed** to extract the correct information.
- There are evolutionary reasons for introns. Noncoding introns favored evolution of **multi-domain proteins**.
- Rapid evolution new combinations of **functional domains**.
