- 80% of genome contains elements (active RNA molecules) with biochemical function.
- 18,400 RNA genes & 20,687 protein-coding genes.
- **RNA is a major functional unit of the epigenome**
- 76% of genome transcribed to RNA not to proteins.
- **Evolution** can occur by **selection for RNA sequences that alter gene regulation**, not just selection for protein-coding sequences.
