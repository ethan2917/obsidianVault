- More species exist near the tropics.
	- They are at a higher density
- The tropics get more sunlight radiation every year meaning that the plants and animals have more energy.
- There are a lot of [[Niche]]'s in the rainforest.
- The competition resources is extreme, but because the climate and resources are more stable the species are able to specialize.
- Speciation happens faster near the equator.
	- Plants and animals grow faster, driving competition forcing plans and animals to specify.
- Species from the rainforest seed biodiversity in other areas.
