### Review Questions
> [!question] What are the four most common elements found in living organisms?
> > [!todo] Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen

> [!question] What causes the transition from blue earth to red earth?
> > [!todo] The oxygen produced by first living organisms during blue earth reacted with iron already present on earth. This causes iron in the ocean to rust and have rock formations a red color.

> [!question] How did the greenhouse effect of the white stage lead to the green stage of earth?
>> [!todo] Volcanoes caused CO2 to rise, increased the greenhouse effect, the temperature rose and melted snowball earth. This heat, along with some oxygen, allowed oragnisms (plants, microbes, etc.) to thrive and Earth entered "green stage".

### Finding Additional Planets
- Scientists thought it would take decades to examine the atmospheres around distant planets.
	- Now new world techniques provide a look at planets beyond our solar system.

#### Transiting Exoplanet Surver Satellite (TESS) 2018
- Updated cameras and an optimal orbital path will work in conjunction with the James Webb telescope to aalyze exoplanets and positively identify those with liquid water on the surface.
- After liquid water, the next most important trait to look at is the oxygen content of the atmosphere.
> [!question] Why would high oxygen levels be an almost sure sign of life thrivig on the planet?
> > [! todo]

#### James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
- Deployed in 12/25, 2021
- Higher resolution and clarity as compared to previous satellites.
> [!question] Where is visible light?
> >[!todo] 400-700 nanometers
- Webb will study every phase in the history of the solar system.

## Life on Other Planets
- Comets

### Curisity Rover Searches For The Ingredients of Life on Mars
- Nasa's Curiosity rover has detected **boron**, a key ingredient for life on the surface of Mars.
> [!important] Borates are one possible bridge from simple organic molecules to RNA - boron stabilizes the structure of ribose.

> [!quote] The presence of boron tells us that, if organics were present on Mars, these chemical reactions **could have occurred**.

## Emergence
### Emergent Properties: From Elements to an Ionic Molecule
- Common table salt
- Chemical formula is NaCl
- Salt is one atom of Na+ and one Cl-.
### What Are the Emergent Prperties that Add up to the Basics for a Protocell?
- Atoms formed
- Atomes combined to make precursor molecules.
- .
### Emergence is a Property of Living and Non-living Systems
- Emergence of order and self organization in non-living systemes and living systems is similar.
> [!info] Both depend on energy flows that maintain the systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium.
- .
- The giant ant hill or the school of fish are visible patterns..
> [!question] What is the ultimate emergent property/event?
>> [!important] Life!!

### Life is an Emergent Property
- Life is the ultimate emergent property
- Life arose as an inexorable sequence of emergent events, each the inevitable...
