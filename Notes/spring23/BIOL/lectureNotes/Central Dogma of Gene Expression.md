- [[The Central Dogma]] of gene expression describes the flow of information from gene to protein, yielding the organism's phenotype.
- This takes place in two phases:
	- **Transcription: DNA -> mRNA**
	- **Translation: mRNA -> Proteins**
- This entire process is highly regulated and influenced by changes in an organism's environment and internal regulation.
