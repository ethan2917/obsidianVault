- Experiments have shown that polypeptides can form microscopic fluid-filled spheres.
- If certain kinds of lipids are in a solution, selectively permeable membranes will form.
- These **molecular packages** are referred to as either **pre-cells**.
	- Pre-cells are artificially made and can incorporate genetic material, creating a **synthetic cell**.
		- This can be the basis for the construction of **artificial life**.
