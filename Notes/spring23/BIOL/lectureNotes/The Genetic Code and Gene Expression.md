> [!question] What is a gene?
- The idea of the gene has evolved through the history of genetics:
	- A discrete unit of inheritance (Gregor Mendel)
	- Specific regions of chromosome where Mendel's units of inheritance are located (Thomas Morgan)
	- A DNA sequence that codes for a specific polypeptide chain (late 20th century).
- Today, a gene can be defined as a region of DNA that can be used as a template to produce a final **functional product**, either a polypeptide or a function RNA molecule.
- **Gene expression**, the process by which DNA directs protein synthesis, includes two stages:
	- Transcription (DNA -> RNA)
	- Translation (RNA -> Proteins)
- **Transcription** is the synthesis of RNA, using information in DNA, performed by the enzyme **RNA polymerase**.
	- Different types of RNA have different roles in cells, but typically transcription yields **messenger RNA** (mRNA)
- **Translation** is the synthesis of a polypeptide, using information in mRNA, performed by ribosomes.
- The flow of information from gene to protein is based on a **triplet code;**
	- A series of non-overlapping, three nucleotide sequences.
- The nucleotide sequence of a gene is **transcribed** into complementary non-overlapping three-nucleotide sequences of mRNA called **codons**.
- These sequences are then **translated** into a chain of amino acids, forming a polypeptide.
