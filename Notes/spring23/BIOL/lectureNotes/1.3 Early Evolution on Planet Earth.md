## Cell Types at Different Time Periods:
### Protocells (4 BYA):
- Conditions led to possibility of protocells.
	- Many comets and asteroid impacts occurred at this time.
	- Could have led to more favorable conditions.
		- High carbon content over 90 elements
### Bacteria (3.8 - 3.5 BYA):
- Prokaryotes (bacteria) emerge
	- These cells were most likely from the domain bacteria but could have been an earlier more primitive cell type than bacteria, and thus all life, descend from prokaryotic cells.
	- Conditions were anaerobic on Earth, good for forming biomolecules, but **cellular metabolism was limited without oxygen**.
### Archae (3.7 BYA):
![[1.3 Early Evolution on Planet Earth-1.png | 400]]
- Archae share many of their traits with Bacteria but differ significantly in their ribosomal structure and other components of gene expression.
	- They resemble eukaryotes in these regards.
- Archaea today are commonly found in extreme environments high temperature/pressure.
### Photosynthetic Bacteria (3.2 BYA):
- *Aquifex* is an example of a living fossil.
	- It has **cyclic photosynthesis** and is an extremophile growing at 95C.
### Eukaryotes (2.7 BYA):
- Beginning of more complex life.
- Eukaryotes can be considered a single branch of the *Asgard* archaea.

## Domains of Life

## Prokaryotic Cell
![[1.3 Early Evolution on Planet Earth-4.png | 400]]
- Bacteria and Archaea usually have a limited number of shapes (bacillus shape)
- No Nucleus
- No internal membrane
- Pili adhesion (not all)
- Flagella movement (not all)
- Cell walls are required to maintain shape

## Eukaryotic Cells
- Vary widely in their cellular structure.
- Common traits: 
	- Intracellular membranes
	- Complex cytoskeleton
	- Mitochondria
	- Plastids in photosynthesizes
- Among multicellular organisms many cell types exists within a single organism, each with very different forms and functions.

## Universal Features of Cellular Life Common to Prokaryotes & Eukaryotes
![[1.3 Early Evolution on Planet Earth-5.png | 200]]
- Enclosed by a membrane
- Store hereditary information in DNA
- Replicate DNA using the same basic mechanism
- Use RNA for transcription of DNA
- Translate RNA into protein via tRNA & ribosomes
- Use proteins as catalysts
- Use ATP for free energy
### Cells are Complex Systems
![[1.3 Early Evolution on Planet Earth-6.png | 300]]
- Most free-living Archaea & Bacteria have 1000-4000 genes and single chromosome.
- Eukaryotes have more genes, multiple chromosomes and a variety of organelles.

## Origins of Eukaryotic Life
![[1.3 Early Evolution on Planet Earth-8.png | 400]]
- The oldest fossils of Eukaryotic cells date back to 2.1 BYA.
- The simplest eukaryote has a nuclear envelope, **mitochondria**, endoplasmic reticulum, and a cytoskeleton.
- Eukaryotes originated by **endosymbiosis** between an anaerobic Archaeal direct ancestor and an aerobic bacterium.
- An **endosymbiont** is an organism that **lives within another organism**
	- The host provides protection and nutrients, while the smaller organisms **provides the host with something it needs**.
