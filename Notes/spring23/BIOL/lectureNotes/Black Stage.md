- Earth formed - meteorites, rocks and dust present at the start of our solar system.
- Over time planets collided and rocks started circling the sun.
- Earth was hot molten rock but began to cool and solidify into basaltic rock.
- Earth's solidified surface became molten again after a planetoid called Theia collided with it.
	- This even produced the Moon.
```ad-question
Could life have come from Theia? Other meteorites?
