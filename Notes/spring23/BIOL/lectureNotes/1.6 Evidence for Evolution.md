## The Big Five Extinctions
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution.png]]

## Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction: K-T
- **Iridium** is much more common in meteors than Earth rocks.
- **Stratigraphy**: Iridium layer at K-T boundary is situated between the **end of the age of reptiles** and the **beginning of the age of mammals**.

## Why Adaptive Radiations After Max Extinctions?
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution-1.png | 300]]
- **Adaptive Radiation** is rapid evolution based on the availability of open **niche space**.
- A **niche** is a position or role taken by a type of organism within the biological community.
- Mass extinctions leave **may niches unoccupied** by competitors.
	- New resources are available to the surviving speicies.
	- As speciation increases withing a group, a selective force allows for adaptations to diversify.
### Anatomical Developmental Patterns: Vertebrate Embryos
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution-2.png | 400]]
- Different vertebrate embryos at similar stages in early embryogenesis.
	- Actual embryos are not identical but exhibit comparable morphologies in early development.
### Anatomical Comparative Anatomy: The Vertebrate Forearm
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution-3.png | 400]]
> [!question] Analogous or Homologous?
> > [!todo] Homologous
- **Analogous**: When organisms adapt to the same environment.
- **Homologous**: When organisms adapt to different environments.

## Molecular Commonalities Among Cells
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution-4.png]]
### Molecular Biochemistry:
#### Amino Acids Sequences of Proteins
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution-5.png | 300]]
- The **number of differences correlate with the time since organisms last shared a common ancestor**.
	- The more differences, the longer since they shared a common ancestor.
- Phylogenetic trees derived from **amino acid differences are quite like those derived by other criteria**.
	- Morphological
	- Genomic
#### Beta Hemoglobin Differences
- Differences in B-hemoglobin indicate
	- How recent a common ancestor is shared among organisms
	- How closely related a group of organisms must be
	- Correlate with hereditary information
		- DNA
- The more differences, the longer since they shared a common ancestor.
- When the number of differences are similar, the pairs of organisms are likely to have shared a common ancestor at about the same time in the past.

## Convergent Evolution
- Convergent evolution is the process by which **unrelated or distantly related organisms closely evolve**.
	- Body forms, coloration, organs, and adaptations.
- **Sympatry**: Same environment and geographic range.
	- **Batesian mimicry**: One species gains protection by appearing to be another species.
	- **Mullerian mimicry**: Both species benefit from similar appearance (bees and wasps)

## Primates
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution-6.png]]
- **Adaptive radiation** made possible by the extinction of dinosaurs after 65 MYA.
- Most living primates today are **arboreal**, and **natural selection** has aided the ability to survive in trees.
- Species **coevolved** with flowering trees since **flowers and fruit** are a food resource.
### What are the advantages of:
#### 1. Grasping Hand
- Grip branches
- Grip objects/prey more powerfully and precisely
- Use tools
#### 2. Binocular Vision
- Depth perception
- Excellent focus
- Advantage when living in trees
- But limits field of view
#### 3. Large Brain
- Sensory input (acute visual system)
- Motor ouput
- Social interactions
- Learning, memory, info gathering
#### 4. Parental Care and Sociality (High Parental Investment)
- Increase *biological fitness* by helping offspring reach maturity and reproduce.
### Early Primate (30 Million Years Ago)
- *Aegyptopithecus Zeuxis* was a transitional state leading to "Old World Monkeys"
- Discovered in 2006 in Egypt
- Arboreal and fruit eating
- Size of a house cat with very small brain
- Excellent vision
- **Sexual dimorphism**: A phenotypic difference between males and females of the same species, meaning that there are obvious differences between the males and females of the same species.
	- Morphology, size, ornamentation, and behavior.
- Old and new world monkeys have more teeth, nostril shape direction, prehensile tails.
	- Old are native to Africa and Asia
	- New are indigenous to the Americas

## Human Evolution
![[1.6 Evidence for Evolution-7.png]]
### Hypotheses
1. Multiregional hypothesis
2. Out of Africa hypotheses
	- The most strongly supported hypothesis.
### Australopithecus afarensis
- Fossils of "Lucy" were discovered in the afar region of Ethiopia
- The skull is larger than a chimp.
- Lucy stood 4' tall and had longer arms than current humans.
- The shape of the pelvis and hips are different to support **bipedalism**.
### Homo Habilis
- The first to use *complex tools* and to *consistently walk upright* (bipedal).
	-  Others before could walk upright but most likely only occasionally.
- They *may have* used more complex tools, but the extensive use of stone tools is clear.
### Homo Erectus
- The name *upright man* is a misnomer, as it is now known that earlier members of the Homo genus also walked upright.
- This was a highly successful human species and likely the first humans to migrate out of Africa.
	- Having spread throughout **southern and eastern Asia and parts of Europe**
- They persisted for about 1.7 million years.
### Homo neanderthalensis
- Neanderthals, like Homo sapiens were decedents of Homo erectus.
- They were highly developed hominins that spread across **Europe and western and central Asia**
- They were *partly* ancestors of the modern human populations, having **interbreed with Homo sapiens**.
- Although they were large brained bipeds like us, there are many differences in skills and skeletons.
- They were stockier, heavier built, and likely stronger than modern humans.
- They had larger skulls and correspondingly larger cranial cavities, implying a **larger brain than modern humans**.
#### Another Way of Being Human
- Exhibited care for others
- Buried their dead
- Sophisticated stone tools
- Musical instruments
- Jewellery and ornamentation
- Most likely had spoken language
### Human Culture
