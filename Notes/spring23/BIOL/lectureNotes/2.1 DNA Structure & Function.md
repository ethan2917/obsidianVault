## What is DNA & How Does It Work?
- **DeoxyriboNucleic Acid**
- A molecular blueprint for a living thing (the **genotype**), containing information (**genes**) on how to build all the proteins found in every cell of the body.
- It also contains information that *regulates* when, where, and how much of each protein will be made.
- The **phenotype** (observable characteristics) of an organism is fundamentally based on the genetic "blueprint"/
	- However, other factors, like external, environmental factors influence the final product, and have a profound impact on its phenotype.
### Amino Acids
- The building blocks of life
- They can attach to each other to create proteins.
### Proteins
- Must be formed in a perfect shape to function
### How DNA Helps
- It tells amino acids how to line up and form perfect protein shapes.
- If the right proteins are built at the right time in the right place everything should come out fine.
- DNA lives inside the nucleus.
- Amino acids live in the cytoplasm.
- To help DNA react with cytoplasm the cell converts amino acids into proteins.
### RNA
- Special chemicals inside the nucleus make partial copies of the DNA code called **RNA**.
- The RNA moves into the **ribosome** to read the RNA code and chain amino acids according to the RNA code.

## The Search for Genetic Material
- The concept of a **gene** was established by **Gregor Mendel** in the mid 19th century with his study of inheritance in pea plants.
- From him, we learned terms like **genotype**, **phenotype**, and:
	- **Gene**: A heritable characteristic (e.g., flower color)
	- **Alleles**: Variations of a gene (e.g., different colors)
	- **Dominant trait**: The trait that masks expression of a recessive allele (e.g., white flowers)
	- **Recessive trait**: The trait that is "masked" by the dominant allele (e.g. white flowers)
- In the 1920's by crossbreeding fruit flies and tracking each generation's traits and the rate at which pairs of traits were recombined. **Thomas Morgan's** group showed that genes are located on chromosomes.
- In fact. using this method they were able to *map the locations of genes in fruit fly chromosomes*.
- The two components of chromosomes, **DNA** and **protein**, became early candidates for what genetic material may be.

### Structure of DNA
#### Nucleotides
![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function.png | 300]]
- After DNA was accepted as life's genetic material, the challenge was to determine how its structure accounts for its role in heredity.
- DNA was known to be composed of nucleotides, specifically **deoxyribonucleotides**.
- No matter what organism was studied it was found that DNA was built out of only **4 different types of deoxyribonucleotides**, each varying only in their **nitrogenous base**.
#### Nitrogenous Base
![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-1.png | 300]]
- In 1950, **Erwin Chargaff** reported that DNA nitrogenous base composition varies from one species to the next.
- They did not have a means to sequence DNA yet, but from chemical studies of DNA, Chargaff established two rules:
	1. The base composition of DNA varies between species.
	2. This variation depends on amount of **A = T** and **G = C** within a species
- The basis for these rules was not understood until the discovery of the DNA double helix.
#### Rosalind Franklin
- Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin used a technique called **X-ray crystallography** to study molecular structure.
- In 1952, Franklin produced a picture of the DNA molecule using *Photo 51*.
- Using Franklin's image as the crucial piece of evidence, Watson and Crick went on to publish their Nobel-Prize winning DNA structure.
#### Photo 51 Provided a Wealth of Information
- ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-2.png]]
#### Piecing Together the Structure of DNA
- Franklin's X-ray crystallographic images enabled Watson and Crick to deduce the **geometry of DNA** and with the known chemical properties of nucleotides and DNA they were able to assemble a structure model of DNA.
- The X-ray images indicated the **width of the helix** and the **spacing of the nitrogenous bases**.
- The pattern was suggested that the DNA molecule was made up of **two strands** forming a **double helix**.
- Franklin had concluded that there were two outer sugar-phosphate backbones, with the **nitrogenous bases paired in the molecule's interior**.
- The only model that fits Franklin's data was one in which the backbones were **antiparallel** (their subunits run in opposite directions).
##### Base Pairing
- Watson and Crick thought the bases paired **like with like** e.g. A with A, G with G, and so on.
- Such pairings did not result in a uniform width, and this **did not match Franklin's data** showing DNA has a constant width.
- Instead, pairing a **purine** with a **pyrimidine** resulted in a uniform width.
	- Purines: A and G
	- Pyrimidines: C and T

## Functions of DNA
- As the "master molecule" of life, DNA must:
1. Reliably **carry the heritable the heritable information** contained in genes that enable phenotypic expression.
### Carrying Genetic Information
- The **unique sequences of bases** represent the information that is past down from parent to offspring.
- The nature of DNA double helix is ideal for storage information:
	- The nitrogenous bases **face inward**, not easily accessed by highly reactive chemicals that could damage the bases and alter the information.
	- The sugar-phosphate backbones don't carry information, so if the backbone is damaged, **the genetic information isn't at risk** of being altered.
	- The sugar-phosphate backbone is strong but **flexible**.
	- The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds, and since they are **weak interactions** (compared to covalent bonds) the double helix is easily separated, allowing access to genetic information without damaging the structural integrity of the molecule. 
	- DNA is packaged together with proteins called **histones** to form **chromatin** that can be packed into dense structures to allow chromosomes to be easily separated during mitosis
	- Chromatin changes in packing during the cell cycle.
	- At **interphase** (mitosis), chromosomes are not highly condensed, but they still occupy specific restricted regions in the nucleus.
	- Dense packing (called **heterochromatin**) makes it difficult for the cell to express genetic information coded in these regions, silencing those genes.
	- Histones can undergo chemical modifications that result in changes in chromatin organization and thus change gene expression.
2. Be able to **replicate itself** for cell division and propagation of the species.
### Replication
- Watson and Crick noted that the specific **base pairing suggested a possible copying mechanism**:
	- Since the two strands of DNA are **complementary**, each strand **acts as a template** for building a new strand.
	- In DNA replication, the parent molecule unwinds, and two new daughter strands are built based o base-pairing rules ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-5.png | 500]]
	- The copying of DNA is remarkable in its speed, accuracy and complexity.
	- More than a dozen enzymes and many other proteins participate in DNA replication.
	- The enzyme that directly polymerizes nucleotides is called **DNA polymerase**.
	- DNA polymerases catalyze the elongation of DNA at a replication fork.
	- Each nucleotide that is added to a growing DNA strand is a **deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)**
	- **Hydrolosis of these phosphates powers DNA replication** just as hydrolysis of ATP to ADP powers other enzymatic reactions elsewhere in the cell.
	- The initial nucleotide strand is a short **RNA primer**;
		- DNA replication cannot begin without a primer.
	- DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the free 3' end of a growing strand;
		- Therefore, a new DNA strand can **elongate only in the 5' to 3' direction**
	- This means that at each replication fork there is a **leading strand**, which can be synthesized continuously, and a **lagging strand** that must be **synthesized in segments**.
	- To elongate the lagging strand DNA polymerase must work in the **direction away from the replication fork**.
	- The lagging strand is synthesized as a series of segments called **Okazaki fragments**, which are joined together by DNA ligase.
#### The Central Dogma
- The triplet code, transcription, translation and the idea of "one gene-one protein" became the foundation for the "**central dogma**" first defined by Francis Crick in 1958:
- In other words: there is a **one-way flow of information** from genes to mRNA (messenger) and tRNA (transfer) to proteins.
> [!quote] "The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information. It states such information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid." - F. Crick
3. Have a mechanism for translating DNA sequences into amino acid/protein sequences (a **genetic code**).
### The Genetic Code and Gene Expression
> [!question] What is a gene?
- The idea of the gene has evolved through the history of genetics:
	- A discrete unit of inheritance (Gregor Mendel)
	- Specific regions of chromosome where Mendel's units of inheritance are located (Thomas Morgan)
	- A DNA sequence that codes for a specific polypeptide chain (late 20th century).
- Today, a gene can be defined as a region of DNA that can be used as a template to produce a final **functional product**, either a polypeptide or a function RNA molecule.
- **Gene expression**, the process by which DNA directs protein synthesis, includes two stages:
	- Transcription (DNA -> RNA)
	- Translation (RNA -> Proteins)
- **Transcription** is the synthesis of RNA, using information in DNA, performed by the enzyme **RNA polymerase**.
	- Different types of RNA have different roles in cells, but typically transcription yields **messenger RNA** (mRNA)
- **Translation** is the synthesis of a polypeptide, using information in mRNA, performed by ribosomes.
- The flow of information from gene to protein is based on a **triplet code;**
	- A series of non-overlapping, three nucleotide sequences.
- The nucleotide sequence of a gene is **transcribed** into complementary non-overlapping three-nucleotide sequences of mRNA called **codons**.
- These sequences are then **translated** into a chain of amino acids, forming a polypeptide.
- ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-6.png]]
#### The Triplet Code and George Gamow
- The theoretical physicist **George Gamow** first suggested that a **3-letter code** must be employed to encode the **20 standard amino acids**.
- Given 4 different nucleotides, a code based on 2 nucleotides could only code for **16 amino acids**.
- Again, all living organisms use **20 amino acids**.
- A **code of 3 nucleotides** could code for **64 amino acids**
> [!info] A code based on all 4 nucleotides would be superfluous
#### The Genetic Code
- The **genetic code** is a set of rules by which information encoded in specific base sequences of DNA (i.e., in the genes) is **translated into** a corresponding sequence of **amino acids**.
- The **amino acids** are then used to construct of **peptide chains**.
- The code is based on sets **3 nucleotides** which are called **codons**
- Each of the **20 amino acids** found in the proteins of living organisms is coded for by specific **codons**.
> [!example] UUU and UUC specifies the amino acid phenylalanine, CUU (and 5 other codons!) code for leucine
#### Codon Table
- ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-7.png]]
> [!note] The code is **redundant**, i.e., more than one triplet can code for the same amino acid.

> [!info] Genes can be transplanted from one species to another and will still code for the same protein product; when this is done, we call these genes **transgenes**.
4. The allowance of genetic variation by random changes in genetic variation by random changes in genetic information (**mutation**) and a way to limit DNA damage (**DNA repair**).
### Mutations and Repair
- **Mutations** are defined as changes in the information stored in genetic material.
- These changes are the source of **genetic variation in a population** and are necessary for a species to evolve and **adapt to a changing environment**.
- **Changing just one or a few nucleotides** in DNA can lead to the production of an **abnormal protein** that may be nonfunctional, have an altered function, or might be toxic/cause **damage to tissues**.
- A **nucleotide-pair substitution** replaces one complementary pair of nucleotides with another pair of nucleotides.
- **Silent mutations** have no effect on the amino acid produced by a codon because of redundancy in the genetic code (i.e., a changes one codon to another but **both codons code for the same amino acid**).
- **Missense mutations** still code for an amino acid, but not the correct amino acid.
	- For example, changing one nucleotide pair of the hemoglobin gene causes sickle-cell disease.
- **Nonsense mutation** change an amino acid codon into a stop codon, **truncating** the polypeptide and nearly always lead to a nonfunctional protein.
- ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-8.png | 300]]
- A **one base substitution** in the gene coding for hemoglobin causes sickly cell anemia.
- The mutant hemoglobin molecules group into long bundles that form larger structures that stretch and distort the cell.
- ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-9.png | 300]]
- **Insertions** and **deletions** are additions or losses of one or more nucleotides pairs in a gene.
- Compared to nucleotide-pair substitutions, these types of mutations are **more likely to have disastrous effects** on the resulting protein.
- Insertion or deletion of any number nucleotides that is not divisible by three (the length of a codon) will alter the reading frame, producing a **frameshift mutation**.
- ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-10.png | 200]]
- ![[2.1 DNA Structure & Function-11.png]]
- **Spontaneous mutations** can occur during DNA replication, recombination, or repair.
- **Mutagens** are physical or chemical agents that can increase the rate of mutation either directly or indirectly.
- Different repair mechanisms are used to restore damaged DNA, but some of these mechanisms are not very accurate and may lead to mutation.
