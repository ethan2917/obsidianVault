- 3 genes:
	- **lacZ, lacY & lacA** and a **promoter region (Plac)** that allow efficient digestion of lactose.
- **When lactose is absent** transcription of the **lacZ, lacY, & lacA** genes is **turned off by a repressor protein** that binds to the promoter.
	- The RNA polymerase is blocked, transcription is prevented, and there is no mRNA transcript.
- **When lactose is present**, it **binds to the repressor,** changed its shape and **prevents it from binding to the promoter**.
