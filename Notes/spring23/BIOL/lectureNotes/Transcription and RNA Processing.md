- DNA transcribed to a **primary RNA transcript**
- **GTP Cap** is attached to **5' end**
	- Prevents degradation
- **Poly A tail** at **3' end**
	- Serves as nuclear export signal.
- **Spliceosome** cuts out **introns** and reassembles transcript and the final **mRNA** transcript is **transported to the cytoplasm**.
