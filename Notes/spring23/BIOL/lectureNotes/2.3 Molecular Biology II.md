## Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes
### Importance of Gene Regulation In Eukaryotes
- Gene regulation determines which genes are expressed (transcribed by mRNA) within a given cell.
- Every cell in our bodies contains a complete copy of all 21,000+ genes.
- All cells are the same genetically but turn different genes **on and off** to produce different proteins as needed.
- During development of a fetus, 1000s of genes are turned **on and off**.
- Eukaryotes use **multiple mechanisms** including operon type feedback to regulate gene expression.
### Eukaryotic Mechanisms of Gene Regulation
- All cells contain the same genotype.
- Differential gene expression leads to different cell types.
- Multiple mechanisms to regulate gene expression.
	- **DNA packing** prevents access of the DNA for transcription.
	- Eukaryotic transcription has **multiple enhancers, silencers**, and a variety of proteins that are assembled into a complex.
	- **Alternative RNA splicing** leads to multiple mRNAs for translation.
	- There are **microRNAs and RNA interference**.
	- **Translation** and **later events also regulated**.
### Eukaryotic Transcription Complexes: Multiple Proteins & Regulatory Factors
| Name                  | Function                                                                                        |     |     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Enhancer              | DNA Sequence where transcription factors bind                                           |     |     |
| Transcription factors | Regulatory proteins that bind the enhancer and help RNA polymerase bind to the promoter |     |     |
| Promoter              | DNA sequence that RNA polymerase binds to, to initiate transcription.                   |     |     |
| RNA polymerase        | Enzyme that transcribes a gene into RNA                                                 |     |     |
### Transcription Factors (TF) Are Central To Regulation
- **Transcription Factors (TF)** are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences & control the transcription of DNA to mRNA.
	- They promote or block RNA polymerase, the enzyme that copies genetic information from DNA to RNA.
- **2600 proteins** or 10% of human genome function as TFs.
- TFs are critical to the right genes being expressed in the right cells at the right time.
	- There are many TFs involved in the development of the zygote.
- Most important are the **homeodomain** proteins coded for by **homeobox genes**.
### Homeobox (HOX) Genes - The Body Plan Genes
![[2.3 Molecular Biology II.png | 400]]
- A fly's body has 3 major sections, **Head, Thorax and Abdomen**.
- **HOX genes** are transcription factors that regulate the body plan of an embryo along the **"head-tail" axis**.
- **HOX short for "homeobox,"** a combination of the term **homeotic**, which means to **"produce something similar"** and the box like structure of the HOX proteins.
#### Recap: HOX Genes and Development
![[2.3 Molecular Biology II-1.png | 300]]
- Different colored strains were used to show exactly where **different HOX genes** were expressed in the **developing egg and embryo** of a fruit fly.
- As can be seen, each **HOX gene** is expressed in a specific region along the **anterior-posterior ("head-tail") axis of the body**.
### HOX Genes and Development
- In normal **Drosophila spp.** adults, the **second thoracic segment develops a pair of wings**, and the **third thoracic segment develops a pair of modified wings called halteres**.
- For wings and halteres to develop properly, the **HOX gene, Ubx**, must be expressed with precise timing.
	- When **Ubx is artificially turned off** the fly develops a **second pair of wings** instead of halteres.
### Conservation: HOX Genes Between Drosophila & Mammals
![[2.3 Molecular Biology II-2.png | 300]]
- Remarkably all animals from flies to humans rely on **same set of HOX genes** for development.
- As shown in the figure, the same HOX gene (HOX 9 green) controls the **posterior part of the body in Drosophila and mice**.
- The **thoracic regions are also controlled by the same HOX genes** (HOX 9 green, and HOX 8 blue).
### Class Discussion
> [!question] **We share 60% of our genes with *Drosophila* and 50% with Bananas. Why do species across such disparate taxa have so many genes in common?**
> > [!todo] 1. Descent from a common ancestor.
> > 2. Common cellular mechanisms across all living organisms.
> > 3. Certain key genes are conserved, and even small mutations can disrupt cell processes and reduce fitness.
> > 4. New functionality doesn't always involve new genes. It can arise from combinations & shuffling of existing genes.

## Epigenetics
- **Epigenetics** is the study of **heritable changes in gene expression** (active vs. inactive genes) that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence.
	- **A change in phenotype without a change in genotype** that can affect how cells read genes.
### Epigenomic Control of Gene Expression
- Epigenomic change agents include:
	- **Methyl groups (CH3)** that can attach to the DNA and activate or repress gene expression.
	- **Acetyl groups** & other chemicals can attach to histone packaging of DNA & make genes accessible.
	- **Small RNA molecules** that can attach to DNA or the histones and turn genes on and off.
- Errors in the epigenetic process can lead to abnormal gene activity, cancers, metabolic problems and developmental disorders.

## What is RNA Interference (RNAi)
- **RNA interference (RNAi)** occurs when RNA molecules in combination with proteins destroy mRNA molecules before they reach the ribosomes and hence suppress the expression of associated genes.
	- For example viruses.
- **Craig Mello and Andrew Fire** received the **Nobel prize in 2006** for their discovery of "a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information".

### MicroRNAs (miRNA) Play Major Role in Gene Expression
- Small single stranded RNA (20-26 nucleotides) associated with protein.
- Promote degradation or block translation of mRNA and hence silence target genes.
- Expression of 1/3 of human genes regulated by ~1000 miRNAs - critical for development.
### RNAi Regulates Gene Expression: Includes Both miRNA & siRNA
| Type  | Function                     | Details                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| miRNA | Silence many different genes | miRNA bases pair with only part of the mRNA bases, this imprecise matching allows miRNAs to target thousands of mRNAs |
| siRNA | Silence specific genes       | siRNA will only bind to specific regions of the mRNA molecule that have exactly the same sequence of base pairs       |      |                              |                                                                                                                       |
- miRNAs and siRNAs guide **RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex)**.
### miRNA Function in Limb Development
- **Dicer gene** is essential for generation of **miRNA in mammals**.
	- If silence, result is **embryonic death**.
- In a study where Dicer was silenced before limb development, **limbs never developed**.
- **miRNAs regulate translation** of 1000s of mRNAs in development.
