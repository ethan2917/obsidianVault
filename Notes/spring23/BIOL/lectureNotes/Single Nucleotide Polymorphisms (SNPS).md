- **Foundation for personalized medicine** - patients know risks of developing diseases from personal SNP profile.
	- Estimated 5 million SNPs in human genome.
	- Haplotype::all SNPs found on a given chromosome
		- International effort to identify every SNP in human genome.
- Data used in genome wide association studies.
	- Rapid scanning of many individual genomes to find SNPs associated with diseases.
	- Crucial to identifying SNPs contributing to complex diseases: Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Bipolar disorder.
