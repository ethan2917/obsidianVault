- The **genetic code** is a set of rules by which information encoded in specific base sequences of DNA (i.e., in the genes) is **translated into** a corresponding sequence of **amino acids**.
- The **amino acids** are then used to construct of **peptide chains**.
- The code is based on sets **3 nucleotides** which are called **codons**
- Each of the **20 amino acids** found in the proteins of living organisms is coded for by specific **codons**.
> [!example] UUU and UUC specifies the amino acid phenylalanine, CUU (and 5 other codons!) code for leucine
