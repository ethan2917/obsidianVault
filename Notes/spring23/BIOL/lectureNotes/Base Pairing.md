- Watson and Crick thought the bases paired **like with like** e.g. A with A, G with G, and so on.
- Such pairings did not result in a uniform width, and this **did not match Franklin's data** showing DNA has a constant width.
- Instead, pairing a **purine** with a **pyrimidine** resulted in a uniform width.
	- Purines: A and G
	- Pyrimidines: C and T
