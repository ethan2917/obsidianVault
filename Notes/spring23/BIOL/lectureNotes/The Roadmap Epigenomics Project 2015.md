- **Roadmap** - the follow-up to **ENCODE**
- ENCODE found that **90% of DNA alterations associated with disease lie in gene switching areas** that code for the **epigenome**, not in protein coding genes.
- To find the switches and trace circuits controlling genes, researches examined 100s of cell types taken from healthy people, patients suffering from diseases, as well as fetal cells and stem cells.
- **Found millions of switches that control genes**.
