- Remarkably all animals from flies to humans rely on **same set of HOX genes** for development.
- As shown in the figure, the same HOX gene (HOX 9 green) controls the **posterior part of the body in Drosophila and mice**.
- The **thoracic regions are also controlled by the same HOX genes** (HOX 9 green, and HOX 8 blue).
### Class Discussion
> [!question] **We share 60% of our genes with *Drosophila* and 50% with Bananas. Why do species across such disparate taxa have so many genes in common?**
> > [!todo] 1. Descent from a common ancestor.
> > 2. Common cellular mechanisms across all living organisms.
> > 3. Certain key genes are conserved, and even small mutations can disrupt cell processes and reduce fitness.
> > 4. New functionality doesn't always involve new genes. It can arise from combinations & shuffling of existing genes.
