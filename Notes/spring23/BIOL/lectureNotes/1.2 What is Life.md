### Review Questions
> [!question] What are the four most common elements found in living organisms?
> > [!todo] Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen

> [!question] What causes the transition from blue earth to red earth?
> > [!todo] The oxygen produced by first living organisms during blue earth reacted with iron already present on earth. This causes iron in the ocean to rust and have rock formations a red color.

> [!question] How did the greenhouse effect of the white stage lead to the green stage of earth?
>> [!todo] Volcanoes caused CO2 to rise, increased the greenhouse effect, the temperature rose and melted snowball earth. This heat, along with some oxygen, allowed oragnisms (plants, microbes, etc.) to thrive and Earth entered "green stage".

### Finding Additional Planets
- Scientists thought it would take decades to examine the atmospheres around distant planets.
	- Now new world techniques provide a look at planets beyond our solar system.

#### Transiting Exoplanet Surver Satellite (TESS) 2018
- Updated cameras and an optimal orbital path will work in conjunction with the James Webb telescope to aalyze exoplanets and positively identify those with liquid water on the surface.
- After liquid water, the next most important trait to look at is the oxygen content of the atmosphere.
> [!question] Why would high oxygen levels be an almost sure sign of life thrivig on the planet?
> > [! todo]

#### James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
- Deployed in 12/25, 2021
- Higher resolution and clarity as compared to previous satellites.
> [!question] Where is visible light?
> >[!todo] 400-700 nanometers
- Webb will study every phase in the history of the solar system.

## Life on Other Planets
- Comets deliver many of the ingredients needed to kick off the emergence of life on a pre-biotic planet.

### Curiosity Rover Searches For The Ingredients of Life on Mars
- Nasa's Curiosity rover has detected **boron**, a key ingredient for life on the surface of Mars.
> [!important] Borates are one possible bridge from simple organic molecules to RNA - boron stabilizes the structure of ribose.

> [!quote] The presence of boron tells us that, if organics were present on Mars, these chemical reactions **could have occurred**.

## Emergence
### Why is the Whole Greater than the Sum of Its Parts?
![[1.2 What is Life.png]]
### Emergent Properties: From Elements to an Ionic Molecule
- Common table salt
- Chemical formula is NaCl
- Salt is one atom of Na+ and one Cl-.
### What Are the Emergent Properties that Add up to the Basics for a Protocell?
- Atoms formed
- Atoms combined to make precursor molecules.
- Precursors form into macromolecules
- Primitive RNAs develop replicase and catalytic activities.
### Emergence is a Property of Living and Non-living Systems
- Emergence of order and self organization in non-living systems and living systems is similar.
> [!info] Both depend on energy flows that maintain the systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium.
- .Emergence of **self-organized chemical systems** at some critical density of organic molecules and intermediate levels of energy may have laid foundation for the origin of life.
- The giant ant hill or the school of fish are visible **patterns** that are generated by the **individual actions of organisms** and cannot be said in themselves to be the purpose of any individual.
- A map of protein interactions or food relationships in the environment is an abstract and complex result of biological phenomena.
> [!question] What is the ultimate emergent property/event?
>> [!important] Life!!
### Life is an Emergent Property
- Life is the ultimate emergent property
- Life arose as an inexorable sequence of emergent events, each the inevitable consequence of interactions **amongst carbon-based molecules**.
### Living Systems: What is Life?
- Laid foundations for molecular biology & understanding of DNA and the gene.
- To maintain itself and escape the inevitable dissolution demanded by the 2nd law of thermodynamic, life constantly takes in energy from the environment.
> [!quote] Living matter evades decay to thermodynamic equilibrium by having a metabolism.

## What is Life?
### Requirements for Life:
- **Growth** - increase size of parts not just accumulate matter.
- **Response** -  react to environmental stimuli.
- **Heredity** -  Ability to evolve traits over time.
- **Metabolism** - convert/use energy to perform function.
- **Reproduction** - capable of producing new organisms from the parent.
- **Order** - generally characterized by ordered structures.
### Viruses-Types & Shapes
![[1.2 What is Life-1.png]]
### Has Artificial Life Been Made?
- 2002 - Complete functioning virus created from commercially available ingredients, synthesized 5386 base DNA chain in test tube
- 2003 - Venter predicts first “living” cell will be synthesized within 5 years
- 2016 - Scientists have created a bacterium with a minimal, life-sustaining genome, but they don’t know what a third of its genes do
- 2019 - Colonies of E. coli thrive with DNA constructed from scratch by humans, not nature
