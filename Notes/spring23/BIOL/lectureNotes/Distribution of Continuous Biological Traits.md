- Many continuous biological traits are **normally distributed**
	- Traits are determined by the **additive effects of many genes**, each having a small positive of negative effect on the phenotype.
- The sum of these effects causes a normal distribution of phenotypes.
- Since selection acts on different phenotypes favoring some and eliminating others, **evolutionary change cannot take place without variation.**
