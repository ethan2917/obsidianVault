- The theoretical physicist **George Gamow** first suggested that a **3-letter code** must be employed to encode the **20 standard amino acids**.
- Given 4 different nucleotides, a code based on 2 nucleotides could only code for **16 amino acids**.
- Again, all living organisms use **20 amino acids**.
- A **code of 3 nucleotides** could code for **64 amino acids**
> [!info] A code based on all 4 nucleotides would be superfluous
