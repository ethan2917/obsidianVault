> [!info] **Goal: Determine nucleotide sequence of all DNA in human genome. Identify the location & sequence of every human gene.**
- **1986** Crucial meeting Santa Fe
- **1988** Project launched
- **2000** 1st draft
- **2003** complete version
- Made possible by:
	- 20 research centers in **6 countries**
	- Increased computer power
	- Advances in **gene sequencing**
	- Competition between **public & private teams**
## Human Genome Project Results
![[2.4 Genomes and Human Genetics-3.png | 300]]
- **~21,000** genes in 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs.
- As many **pseudogenes** (inactivated, nonfunctional copies of genes) as functional genes.
- Only **1.5% of DNA code for proteins**.
- **Remaining 98.5% of DBA contains control regions, noncoding DNA & repetitive DNA**.
