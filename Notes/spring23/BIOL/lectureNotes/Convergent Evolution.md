- Convergent evolution is the process by which **unrelated or distantly related organisms closely evolve**.
	- Body forms, coloration, organs, and adaptations.
- **Sympatry**: Same environment and geographic range.
	- **Batesian mimicry**: One species gains protection by appearing to be another species.
	- **Mullerian mimicry**: Both species benefit from similar appearance (bees and wasps)
