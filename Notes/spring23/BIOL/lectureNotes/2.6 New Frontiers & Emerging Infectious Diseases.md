## Targeted Cancer Therapies
![[2.6 New Frontiers & Emerging Infectious Diseases-4.png]]
### Hormone Therapies
- Treatment of disease or symptoms with synthetic or naturally derived **hormones**.
	- Prostate cancer
		- **Androgen reduction**
- Add, block, or remove hormones from the body to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.
	- Orchiectomy
### Signal Transduction Inhibitors
- A substance that blocks **signals** passed from one molecule to another inside a cell.
- Blocking these **signals** can affect many functions of the cell, including cell division, and cell death.
### Angiogenesis Inhibitors
- Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels.
- When **growth factors** bind to their receptors on **endothelial cells**, signals within these cells are initiated that promote the growth and survival of new blood vessels.
	- Lung cancer, metastasis
- **Angiogenesis inhibitors**, interfere with blood vessel formation.
### Immunotherapies
> [!question] How is **immunotherapy** used to fight cancer? It boosts the body's **natural defenses.**
> > [!todo] T-cells etc.
- It uses substances made by the body or in a laboratory to improve how your immune system works to find and destroy cancer cells.
	- CART cells
### Monoclonal Antibody Therapy
- A form of immunotherapy that uses **monoclonal antibodies** to bind to certain cells or proteins.
	- Herceptin, etc.
- The objective is that this treatment will stimulate the patient's immune system to attack specific cancer cells.

## New Frontiers & Emerging Infectious Diseases
### CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic repeats)

#### CRISPR Simplified

### Stem Cells
#### What Are Stem Cells?
> [!important] Important Characteristics:
> > [!info] - Capable of dividing to renew themselves for long periods.
> > - Unspecialized or undifferentiated.
> > - Can be induced to differentiate into blood, heart muscle, nerve, etc.

> [!important] Two Types:
> > [!info] - *Embryonic stem cells* derived from embryos in vitro fertilized eggs.
> > - *Adult stem cells* - occur in every tissue - typically generate same type of differentiated cells.
#### Yamanaka Inducible Pluripotent Stem Cells
- iPSC are derived from::skin or blood cells that have been reprogrammed back into an embryonic-like pluripotent state.
^1677743835585
	- Enable the development of an unlimited source of any type of human cell needed for therapeutic purposes.
- Pluripotent cell::Cells that are able to self-renew by dividing and developing into three primary groups of cells that make up a human body.
^1677743835589
	- Ectoderm::Skin and nervous system
^1677743835592
	- Endoderm::Gastrointestinal and respirator tracts
^1677743835595
	- Mesoderm::Heart, muscle, bones, and blood
^1677743835598
### Synthetic Biology
- **Synthetic biology**::is a new interdisciplinary area that involves the application of engineering principles to **biology**.
^1677743835600
	- It aims at the (re)design and fabrication of **biological** components and systems that do not already exist in the natural world.
### Emerging Infectious Diseases
#### Antibiotic Resistant "Super Bugs"
- **MRSA - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus**
	- Penicillin resistant strains emerged in 1950s.
	- Methicillin resistance in 1960s.
	- Now resistant to almost all antibiotics
		- Last resort treatment is Vancomycin - extremely toxic
	- Deadly to those with weakened immune systems
	- 2M people/year infected in hospitals ~100,000 deaths
#### Antibiotic Resistant?
- Antibiotics kill the majority of susceptible bacteria quickly, leaving the ones left alive to the immune system.
- A small amount of bacteria in our body may have become immune to our antibiotics.
	- They may spread their immunity to other bacteria.
	- Immunity can be spread quickly.
		- Can even spread between bacteria species.
#### Vocabulary
- Epidemic Diseases::Those that affect large number of people in one area simultaneously.
^1677743835603
- Pandemic::An epidemic that has spread to more than one area.
^1677743835606
#### EIDS: A Growing Problem
- New & resurgent infectious diseases have been a growing health problem.
- Contributing factors:
	- Demographic changes (population growth, inhabiting new areas).
	- Increasing contact with wild & domestic animals.
	- 2/3 of EIDs originate from animals.
	- Behavior (sexual, drugs, hygiene)
	- Poverty & social inequality
	- Climate & changing ecosystems
	- Travel, commerce & transportation
#### Zoonotic Diseases or Zoonosis
- Zoonotic Diseases or Zoonosis::Infectious diseases that can be transmitted from other vertebrates to humans.
^1677743835609
- Of 1415 microbes infectious for humans, 863 are zoonotic.
- 70% of newly recognized pathogens are zoonotic.
##### Five Stages Through Which Pathogens of Animals Evolve to Cause Disease in Humans
![[2.6 New Frontiers & Emerging Infectious Diseases-2.png]]
- Critical transitions:
	- Stage 1 to Stage 2: from animal to human
	- Stages 3 and 4: pathogen's ability to sustain cycles of human-to-human transmissions.
#### Emerging Infectious Diseases Linked to Viruses
- High rate of mutation, contact between species, spread from isolated populations
- RNA Viruses: unusually high rates of mutation lack the proofreading mechanisms seen in DNA replication
	- Common cold, measles, mumps, polio
	- HIV or AIDs virus, West Nile & other
	- SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
	- Dengue & Zika
	- Ebola
	- COVID-19
- DNA Viruses:
	- Hepatitis, chicken pox, herpes
#### Influenza A Virus Contains 8 Genes
