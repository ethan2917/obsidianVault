## Review: Central Dogma of Gene Expression
- The central dogma of gene expression describes the flow of information from gene to protein, yielding the organism's phenotype.
- This takes place in two phases:
	- **Transcription: DNA -> mRNA**
	- **Translation: mRNA -> Proteins**
- This entire process is highly regulated and influenced by changes in an organism's environment and internal regulation.

## The Path from Nucleotides to Proteins
### Summary: Pieces of The Path from DNA to Proteins
- ![[2.2 Molecular Biology I.png]]
### What's the Difference between DNA and RNA?
![[2.2 Molecular Biology I-1.png | 400]]
- Same basic components: base, sugar, phosphate.
- DNA is double stranded, RNA is single stranded.
- **Purines**: Adenine & guanine
- **Pyrimidines**: Cytosine, thymine, & uracil
### Although Linear Sequence of Nucleotides Appears Quite Similar, 3-D Conformations Quite Different
- **RNA** can fold into a **variety of shapes**.
- This conformational complexity allows RNA to serve multiple purposes.
- This makes RNA more diverse than DNA.

## Gene Structure in Eukaryotes
### Exons and Introns
- **Exons** are coding regions
	- They are expressed
- **Introns** are non-coding regions
	- They are removed
### Transcription and RNA Processing
- DNA transcribed to a **primary RNA transcript**
- **GTP Cap** is attached to **5' end**
	- Prevents degradation
- **Poly A tail** at **3' end**
	- Serves as nuclear export signal.
- **Spliceosome** cuts out **introns** and reassembles transcript and the final **mRNA** transcript is **transported to the cytoplasm**.

## Let's Talk Genes:
### Singular, Multiple, Mutations?
- Most **eukaryotic genes** have intervening sequences of nucleotides within the message that they carry,
	- This makes no sense in terms of reading the information.
- Extracting the meaning requires precision.
- The **transcript** of these genes **must be processed** to extract the correct information.
- There are evolutionary reasons for introns. Noncoding introns favored evolution of **multi-domain proteins**.
- Rapid evolution new combinations of **functional domains**.
### Protein-Coding Genes May Be Solitary or Belong to a Gene Family
- **~25-50% solitary genes** that are represented once in genome.
- **~50-75% duplicated genes** are close but nonidentical sequences.
- **~Gene family -> protein family**
	- Ex. protein kinases, immunoglobulins, olfactory receptors with hundreds of family members, cytoskeletal proteins (actin, tubulin), molecular motors (kinesin, myosin, dynein, superfamilies)
- Redundancy can lead to **diversity** which results in **tuning of specific function** and **backup can prevent lethality** if there is a mutation.
- This permits **divergence of function** to evolve.

## Cell Division and Distribution of Genetic Material
### The Human Karyotype
- A **karyotype** is the number of chromosomes in the nucleus of a normal eukaryotic cell.
- Humans have **23 pairs of chromosomes**
	- **22 pairs of autosomal & 1 pair of sex chromosomes;**
		- XX (Female)
		- XY (Male)
- Thus the **2N** or **diploid number of chromosomes in humans is 56 & the haploid number is 23**.
- **Polyploids** are species with 2 or more sets of chromosomes. It is **common in plants** & important in plant speciation.

## Mitosis:
### Cell Division For Growth & Repair of Cells
![[2.2 Molecular Biology I-2.png | 300]]
- When a **somatic cell (non reproductive)** divides the full diploid complement of chromosomes must is passed on to the daughter cells.
- This is accomplished through a complex process of **chromosome duplication** and allocation called **mitosis**.
- **Mitosis** is followed by **cytokinesis** which divides the cytoplasm, organelles & cell membrane equally into **two daughter cells**.
### A Four-Stage Process that Creates Two Identical Cells From One Original Cell
- **Prophase:** Chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.
- **Metaphase:** Chromosomes line up across the center of the call and become connected to the spindle fiber at their centromere.
- **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart.
- **Telophase:** Chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose their distinct rod-like shapes.
	- Two new nuclear membranes then form around each of the two regions.
- **Cytokinesis:** Cell membrane will pinch and divide the cytoplasm in half. The result is two individual cells that are identical to the original cell. Interphase.
### Mitosis = Division
- In **mitosis, two identical sets of DNA** from the parent cell must be perfectly divided and separated **into two new daughter cells.**
- The **mitotic spindle**, is a machine that uses **mechanical forces** like "push, pull, and resistance" **to complete the task.**
	- Like most machinery, the **mitotic spindle can malfunction,** and when it does, DNA can be broken or unevenly divided, errors implicated in the **uncontrolled cell division and cancer**.

## Meiosis:
### Converts Diploid Nuclei to Haploid Nuclei
- **Diploid** cells have **two** homologous sets of chromosomes.
- **Haploid** cells have one **set** of chromosomes.
- **Meiosis produces haploid gametes**
	- **Sperm and eggs**
- Fertilization is the union of **germ** cells (sperm and egg).
	- After fertilization they **zygote** or fertilized egg has a diploid chromosome number, **one haploid set from each parent**.
### Phases of Meiosis
- **Crossing over** happens during prophase I.
- It occurs at sites called **chiasmata**, where the chromosomes are held together.
- **Reductional division** occurs during meiosis I.
- **Meiosis 2** resembles mitosis.

## Summary: Mitosis & Meiosis
| Mitosis                                                    | Meiosis                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| 2. 2n (Diploid) to 2n                                      | 2. Crossing over               |
| 3. One phase                                               | 3. 2n (Diploid) to 1n (Haploid) |
| 4. 2 identical cells                                       | 4. 4 unique cells                               |

## How Are Genes Regulated?
### Parts of the Gene Regulation Pathway
- **Operon:** Unit of DNA that contains genes that can be differentially regulated.
- **Promoter:** Unit of DNA that initiates transcription of a gene.
- **Operator:** Area that interacts with regulatory proteins.
- **Repressor:** Molecule that attaches to DNA to block polymerase from binding.
- **Activator:** Protein that can attach to DNA to increase gene transcription.
- **RNA Polymerase:** Binds to DNA to transcribe RNA.

## Gene Expression:
### The Driver Behind Biology's Central Dogma
- ***E. coli* as model organism to understand prokaryotic gene expression**
- **Features of prokaryotic transcriptional regulation**
- Ability to change metabolic activities in response to the environment.
- Capability to induce/repress enzyme pathways and production.
- Examples of regulated gene networks.
	- *lac operon*
	- *trp operon*
### Positive/Negative Control
![[2.2 Molecular Biology I-3.png | 500]]
- The *lac* operon is an example of an inducible system.
- The *trytophan* operon is an example of a repressible system.
	- Trytophan is an amino acid and the operon controls genes that encode enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway.
### Lac Operon
- First regulation discovered by **Jacob and Monod in 1961**.
- **Proteins interacting with DNA turn prokaryotic genes on/off**.
![[2.2 Molecular Biology I-4.png | 400]]
#### The Lac Operon in *E. Coli*
- 3 genes:
	- **lacZ, lacY & lacA** and a **promoter region (Plac)** that allow efficient digestion of lactose.
- **When lactose is absent** transcription of the **lacZ, lacY, & lacA** genes is **turned off by a repressor protein** that binds to the promoter.
	- The RNA polymerase is blocked, transcription is prevented, and there is no mRNA transcript.
- **When lactose is present**, it **binds to the repressor,** changed its shape and **prevents it from binding to the promoter**.
### Lactose Absent
- 3 enzymes located together on the chromosome and regulated as single unit.
	- lacZ
	- lacY
	- lacA
- Regulatory regions precede the genes encoding the enzymes.
### Lactose Present
- **Lactose present:** operon is active and available for transcription because lactose binds to the repressor protein inducing a conformational change.
- **Repressor/lactose complex** cannot bind to the operator; and RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription.
