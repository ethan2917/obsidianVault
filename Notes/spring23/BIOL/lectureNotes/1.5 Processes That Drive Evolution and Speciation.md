## Announcements
- Exam 1 is one week out.

## Natural Selection
![[1.5 Processes That Drive Evolution and Speciation.png | 400]]
- Daphne Major experienced a drought in 1977.
> [!question] What type of selective pressure do the histograms indicate?
> > [!todo] The histograms indicate natural selection through a need for survival.
### Why Did Beak Size Change?
- Less than 2.4 cm of rain fell on Daphne Major in 1977, causing food resources to become scarce.
	- The smaller, softer seeds on the island were consumed first, and an alternative food source was need.
	- Larger, tougher seeds were present but finches with **smaller beaks struggled** to eat them and died off.
		- Only the larger beaked finches could easily eat these seeds and survive long enough to reproduce.
		- **Larger average beak size** followed in the years following the drought.
- Natural selection can happen very rapidly.

## Coevolution
### Evolutionary *Arms Race* Between Species
- **Coevolution** occurs when the anti-predator adaptations of a prey species cause reciprocal adaptations by the predator that counter or diminish the effects of the prey's adaptation.
	- The predator's counter adaptations in turn cause further adaptations on the part of the prey, etc.
		- For example the Leopard and Antelope
### The *Ghost of Predation Past*
- Now extinct, Pleistocene predators such as short-nosed bears, dire wolf, cheetahs, lions, and saber-toothed cats, were exceptionally fast and drove a **coevolutionary speed race** with the pronghorn.
- Many adaptations of current species *probably* arose as **coevolutionary adaptations** to these large predators and herbivores.
### New Zealand Birds
- In New Zealand, extant terrestrial birds are nocturnal ad large.
- One of New Zealand's extinct birds was the flightless Moa, which was diurnal but grew large.
> [!question] What caused this evolutionary change?
> > [!todo] In New Zealand, a huge predatory eagle which went extinct 1,000 years ago was responsible for driving this evolution.

## Sexual Selection
### Sexual Selection & Evolution
> [!question] Are there costs associated with these exaggerated traits?
> > [!todo] Yes, there are. This costs energy.

> [!question] If there are costs associated with these exaggerated traits, why did they evolve?
> > [!todo] It communicates to the female that they have the resources to support their offspring.

> [!question] Why do females choose males with these exaggerated traits?
> > [!todo] Because they will have a higher chance to have more number of offspring that are also healthy.
### The Sex Life of Voles - Male Choices
- The male *Montane* Vole is polygamous and never settles down with one partner.
- The male *Prairie* Vole is monogamous and chooses a female to settle down with and continually mate.
- The **monogamy gene** in the prairie vole encodes a vasopressin receptor protein where the receptor is prominently present in the brain.
- The **montane voles are missing this gene** and if the gene from prairie voles is engineered into the montane vole, they become pair-bonded and show HPI.

## Genetic Drift
### Genetic Drift in Small Populations
> [!quote] Random changes in allele frequencies brought about by chance alone.
- Cheetah population has been as low as 7,000 with isolated populations.
- Several historical **bottlenecks**.
	- Bottlenecks occur when few members of the species survive.
		- This causes a change in the frequency of certain alleles from the previous population, larger population.
	- After a bottleneck, genetic drift can lower diversity, slow adaptability, and lessen their ability to survive.
### Consequences of Reduced Variation
- Deleterious alleles become **homozygous**
	- Similar to inbreeding depression
	- Occurs when closely related individuals' mate.
- Fewer, and less viable offspring.
- Lower survivorship of populations.
- Increased chance of species extinction.
### Founder Effects
- Unpredictable genetic shifts occurring after a few individuals establish a new population.
- When small numbers of a larger population move to a new location, the genetic diversity may be lower than in the original population.
- Genetic drift can cause fixation of alleles and some of these may be deleterious which impacts overall fitness, while other alleles may enhance fitness.

## Speciation

### What is A Species?
- A **species** is a group of organisms that can **reproduce with one another in nature and produce fertile and healthy offspring.**
- Species are characterized by the fact that they are **reproductively isolated** from other groups due to geographic, temporal, and **genetic drift** eventually leads to differences in reproductive capacities.
	- Receptor proteins on the surface of egg cells cannot recognize sperm.
	- Copulatory organs are physically incompatible.
	- Chromosomes differ in number or structure.
	- Pheromones or mating calls are not recognized by the opposite sex.

### Allopatric
- Other or different
- Speciation in geographically isolated populations.
- Some type of barrier exists that prevents/reduces gene flow.
- Different mutations & different selection pressures cause divergence over time.
### Parapatric
- Alongside of, near
- Parapatric speciation is a special situation where **gene flow between two species is possible**.
- In **hybrid zones** the territory (range) of two closely related species capable of producing offspring overlap.
- The offspring are fertile, but **not as healthy or robust** as either parent population, so the parent populations are still considered to be two different species.
- Those hybrids will reproduce will consequently deliver genes from one species into the gene pools of their main species.
### Sympatric
- Together
> [!quote] The divergence of a single breeding population of one species into two reproductively isolated populations **without any barriers to gene flow**.
