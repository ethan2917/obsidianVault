- **DeoxyriboNucleic Acid**
- A molecular blueprint for a living thing (the **genotype**), containing information (**genes**) on how to build all the proteins found in every cell of the body.
- It also contains information that *regulates* when, where, and how much of each protein will be made.
- The **phenotype** (observable characteristics) of an organism is fundamentally based on the genetic "blueprint"/
	- However, other factors, like external, environmental factors influence the final product, and have a profound impact on its phenotype.
