- Ancience viruses use RNA as genetic material, not DNA.
	- Influenza and Hepatitis are examples
- Further evidence lies in diverse role of RNA in all modern cells and discovery of catalytic functions.
- Only RNA can initiate DNA replication.
- RNA regulates gene expression, repairs genes, carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes.
