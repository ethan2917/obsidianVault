> [!quote] Random changes in allele frequencies brought about by chance alone.
- Cheetah population has been as low as 7,000 with isolated populations.
- Several historical **bottlenecks**.
	- Bottlenecks occur when few members of the species survive.
		- This causes a change in the frequency of certain alleles from the previous population, larger population.
	- After a bottleneck, genetic drift can lower diversity, slow adaptability, and lessen their ability to survive.
