## Genetic Origin of Disease
### Accidents During Meiosis
#### Chromosome Number Alterations
- Nondisjunction::Failure of chromosomes or chromatids to separate during meiosis.
^1677735130976
	- Fertilization after nondisjunction yields zygotes with altered number of chromosomes.
##### Nondisjunction:
###### During Meiosis I
![[2.5 Human Genetics and Personalized Medicine.png | 400]]
- If **nondisjunction** occurs during meiosis I, all gametes will have an abnormal number of chromosomes.
	- **Half will have two copies** of the chromosome pair that failed to separate.
	- **Half will be missing copies** of that chromosome.
- For **Down syndrome**, an egg with **two copies of chromosome 21** can be fertilized by a sperm carrying **one copy of chromosome 21**.
- For the **sex-chromosome abnormality Turner syndrome**, an **egg lacking a copy of the X or Y chromosome** can be fertilized by a **sperm carrying a copy of the X chromosome**.
###### During Meiosis II
![[2.5 Human Genetics and Personalized Medicine-1.png | 400]]
- If **nondisjunction** occurs during **meiosis II**
	- **Half will have correct copies** of the chromosome pair (n).
	- **One quarter** will have an **extra** chromosome (n+1).
	- **One quarter** will be **missing** a chromosome (n-1).
> [!info] Genetic abnormalities can result from an error in meiosis II but are less likely than an error in meiosis I.
##### Meiosis Error Example:
###### Extra Copy of Chromosome 21 Causes Down Syndrome
- **Trisomy 21** is inheritance of **3 copies of chromosome 21**.
> [!important] Most common human chromosome abnormality.
- Imbalance in chromosome number that causes **Down syndrome**.
- Characterized by:
	- Susceptibility to disease.
	- Shortened life span.
	- Cognitive impairment.
	- Characteristic facial features.
	- Frequency increase from 1/1000 to 1/25 with age.
###### Abnormalities of Sex Chromosome Number in Humans

### The Hope of Personalized Medicine
> [!quote] “Imagine the day when you and your doctor sit down to review your own personal genome.  Your genes will inform you of your disease susceptibilities, the best ways to stay healthy and how to avoid or lessen the impact of future illnesses.”
### What is Personalized Medicine?
> [!quote] "Preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions targeted to individuals based on their risk"
- Risk defined through:
	- Molecular testing
	- Genomics
	- Proteomics
	- Metabolomics
	- Epigenomics
	- Family history & data mining
#### Promise of Personalized Medicine
- Advanced **screening and early detection** of disease.
- Informed **prevention, proactive treatments** & lifestyle changes.
- Select safer, **more effective medications** & dosages that reduce side effects.
- Develop **better vaccines** that activate an individual's immune system w/o causing infection.
- BUT the **epigenome** is a major player & it's influence on different diseases needs much more research.
### Genomic Screening & Testing Newborns
- **3,500** genetic diseases cause problems in first month of life.
	- >20% of infant deaths due to a genetic disease.
	- 30% babes in intensive care unit have a genetic disease.
- Can now sequence newborns with mystery conditions in 24 hours.
	- >99;5% specificity of genotypes.
- **Phenomizer** and associated data bases:
	- Aids in reaching **correct diagnosis in patients with hereditary diseases**.
	- **Phenomizer** is an expert system for clinical diagnosis.
	- Connects to the **Phenomizer** data base of 6000+ genetic variants with symptoms.
### Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPS)
- **Foundation for personalized medicine** - patients know risks of developing diseases from personal SNP profile.
	- Estimated 5 million SNPs in human genome.
	- Haplotype::all SNPs found on a given chromosome
^1677740544728
		- International effort to identify every SNP in human genome.
- Data used in genome wide association studies.
	- Rapid scanning of many individual genomes to find SNPs associated with diseases.
	- Crucial to identifying SNPs contributing to complex diseases: Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Bipolar disorder.
### Research Areas Contributing to Personalized Medicine
![[2.5 Human Genetics and Personalized Medicine-2.png]]
#### Biomarker Discovery
-  **Biomarkers**::Any measurable indicator of the state of a body.
^1677740544731
- Some medical experts believe that detecting more complicated **biomarkers** could lead to quicker and more accurate mental health diagnoses.
#### Microbiome Exploration
- Profile an individual's microbiome to detect and diagnose infections and other diseases.
#### Pharmacogenomics
- **Pharmacogenomics**::The study of how our genes affect the way our bodies respond to medications.
^1677740544733
> [!quote] The right drug, for the right patient, at the right dose.
#### Clinomics
- The challenge is in the accurate interpretation of the vast amount of data and effectively using it to guide decisions about your health care.
- Computer science + biology
#### Epigenomics
- Examines which factors act on individual genes, and how certain changes in the epigenome affect our health.

## Personalized Medicine and Cancer
### What is Cancer?
- All cancers **derive from single cells**.
	- DNA in these cells acquired mutations that conferred the ability to continually divide.
- **100s of types of cancer** with different causes, symptoms, & treatments.
- Cancer cells behave abnormally because of changes in DNA of key cancer genes.
	- **Tumor Suppressor Genes & Oncogenes**
	- These changes involve unknown degree of **influence from the epigenome**.
> [!important] All cancers are genetic diseases.
### Development of Cancer
- Rarely occurs from a single mutation but from accumulation of mutations.
- Explains why cancers are associated with **somatic** cells which turnover frequently - due to **random errors in division** that lead to mutations.
- 90% of all cancers are **epithelial cell** origin: lung, breast, colon, skin.
### Oncogenes
- **EGFR** - Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
	- Protein present on the cell surface.
	- Bind to epidermal growth factor causing cells to divide.
	- Abnormally high levels on surface of many cancer cells, causing them to divide excessively in presence of epidermal growth factor.
### Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSG) - Transcription Factors
![[2.5 Human Genetics and Personalized Medicine-3.png]]
- Normally TSG regulate controlled cell division.
- Mutations in these genes can cause cancer by disrupting the amount of transcription factors.
### The Cancer Genome Atlas Project
> [!info] **Goal**: to characterize the molecular changes that happen within cancer cells.
- Profound impact
	- Realization that **there is not one cancer and one type of tumor**.
	- Drugs must target a **specific profile for a given individual**
- We can identify the epigenome associated with the specific cell type of a given individual's cancer.
### Personalized Medicine 
#### Lung Cancer
- Tumor **Genotyping**
	- Genotype **every lung cancer**.
	- Check for array of mutations.
	- Drug therapy based on specific genes mutated.
- **15-20% of individual tumors can be matched to a specific drug**.
- The Cancer Genome Atlas
	- 20 cancer types, 5 years.
	- $275 million in first 2 years.
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) inhibitors - **tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)** that slow down or stop cell growth.
#### Breast Cancer
- Accounts for **one of every three cancer diagnoses**.
- Breast cancer most common cancer in women.
- Highest incidence (80% of cases) in women over 50.
- Four distinct genetic types of the disease were found.
- **Tissue does not define the underlying genetic profile**.
### Genomic Tests: **BRCA1 & BRCA2 Genes**
- BRCA1 & BRCA2 genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA.
- BRCA1 & BRCA2 mutations are usually insertions or deletions of a small number of DNA base pairs in the gene.
- BRCA1 & BRCA2 are unrelated proteins, but both are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue.
- DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer and deficiencies in DNA repair appears to underlie many forms of cancer.
