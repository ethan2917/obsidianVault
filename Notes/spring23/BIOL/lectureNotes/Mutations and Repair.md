[[Mutations]]
- A **nucleotide-pair substitution** replaces one complementary pair of nucleotides with another pair of nucleotides.
- **Silent mutations** have no effect on the amino acid produced by a codon because of redundancy in the genetic code (i.e., a changes one codon to another but **both codons code for the same amino acid**).
- **Missense mutations** still code for an amino acid, but not the correct amino acid.
	- For example, changing one nucleotide pair of the hemoglobin gene causes sickle-cell disease.
- **Nonsense mutation** change an amino acid codon into a stop codon, **truncating** the polypeptide and nearly always lead to a nonfunctional protein.

- A **one base substitution** in the gene coding for hemoglobin causes sickly cell anemia.
- The mutant hemoglobin molecules group into long bundles that form larger structures that stretch and distort the cell.

- **Insertions** and **deletions** are additions or losses of one or more nucleotides pairs in a gene.
- Compared to nucleotide-pair substitutions, these types of mutations are **more likely to have disastrous effects** on the resulting protein.
- Insertion or deletion of any number nucleotides that is not divisible by three (the length of a codon) will alter the reading frame, producing a **frameshift mutation**.

- **Spontaneous mutations** can occur during DNA replication, recombination, or repair.
- **Mutagens** are physical or chemical agents that can increase the rate of mutation either directly or indirectly.
- Different repair mechanisms are used to restore damaged DNA, but some of these mechanisms are not very accurate and may lead to mutation.
