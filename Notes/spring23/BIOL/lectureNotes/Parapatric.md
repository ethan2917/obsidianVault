- Parapatric speciation is a special situation where **gene flow between two species is possible**.
- In **hybrid zones** the territory (range) of two closely related species capable of producing offspring overlap.
- The offspring are fertile, but **not as healthy or robust** as either parent population, so the parent populations are still considered to be two different species.
- Those hybrids will reproduce will consequently deliver genes from one species into the gene pools of their main species.
