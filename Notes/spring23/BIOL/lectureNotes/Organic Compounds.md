- Hydrogen and other elements covalently bond to carbon to form simple organic molecules.
	- Carbon can form four strong covalent bonds, which allows great diveristy of molecular structures.
- These molecules can combine to form more complex molecules, including large **polymers**.
- These **polymers**, along with lipids, are called biological macromolecules.
