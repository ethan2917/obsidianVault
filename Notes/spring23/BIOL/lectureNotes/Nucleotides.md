- After DNA was accepted as life's genetic material, the challenge was to determine how its structure accounts for its role in heredity.
- DNA was known to be composed of nucleotides, specifically **deoxyribonucleotides**.
- No matter what organism was studied it was found that DNA was built out of only **4 different types of deoxyribonucleotides**, each varying only in their **nitrogenous base**.
