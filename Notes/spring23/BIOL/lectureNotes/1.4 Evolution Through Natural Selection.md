## Lecture: 1.4 Evolution Through Natural Selection

## Announcements
- Evolution in the News is due tonight

## Key Contributors to The Theory
![[1.4 Evolution Through Natural Selection.png]]
### Malthusianism
- Thomas Malthus 1766-1834
	- English economist and philosopher
- Population growth will always tend to outrun the food supply.
- The betterment of humankind is impossible without strict limits on reproduction.
- His ideas on the struggles of existence provided a framework that allowed Darwin to work.
### Erasmus Darwin
- All life derived from one original ancestor.
- Grandfather to Charles Darwin.
### Lamarck
- 1744-1829
- Time and favorable conditions
	- Two principal means by which nature gives existence to all her productions
	- Natural laws > miraculous interposition
- "Philosophie Biologique"
### Early Theories of Evolution
- The concept of evolution was not originated by Charles Darwin.
	- Evolution, a slow accumulation of changed over time, was thought by many thinkers during the age of enlightenment.
- A mechanism to explain the process of evolution had yet to be proposed.
- jean-Baptiste Lamarck developed the concept of applied characteristics.
	- This hypothesis, later called **Lamarckism**, stated that organisms passed on characteristics to their offspring by use or disuse of a characteristic during  its lifetime.

## History of Evolution
> [!quote] There is strong quantitative support, for the theory that all living organisms on Earth are descended from one common ancestor - Charles Darwin
- But the mechanism for how one species became two was unknown.
	- Darwin called this question the mystery of mysteries.
> [!quote] It at once struck me under competitive circumstances favorable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavorable ones to be destroyed. The results of this would be the formation of a new species. - Charles Darwin
### Alfred Russel Wallace, Published 1858
- Wallace was the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection and published prior to Darwin.
> [!quote] Thus any variety having slightly increased powers of preserving existence, will inevitably acquire a superiority in number.
### Charles Darwin, Published 1859
> [!quote] This preservation of favorable variations I have called Natural Selection, or "survival of the fittest". - Darwin
### The Voyage of the HMS Beagle
- 5 year voyage (1831-1836)
- His interest in geographic distribution of species was kindled at the Galapagos Islands.
### Descent with Modification
![[1.4 Evolution Through Natural Selection-1.png | 300]]
- The phrase **descent with modification** summarized Darwin's perception of the unity of life.
	- The phrase refers to the view that all organisms are related through descent from an ancestor that lived in the remote past.
- In the Darwinian view, the history of life is like a tree with branches representing life's diversity.
- Darwin's theory meshed well with the hierarchy of Linnaeus (1750s-1760s)
	- Linnaeus was the founder of **taxonomy**, the branch of biology concerned with classifying organisms.
### Evolution by Natural Selection Timeline of Discovery
![[1.4 Evolution Through Natural Selection-2.png | 400]]
### Darwin's Dilemma (Video)
- There is a gap in the fossil record.
	- Pre-Cambrian discoveries did not happen till later.
- The organisms at the bottom of everything did not have anything to leave a fossil record.
	- Microbes could not leave fossils.

## Natural Selection
### Survival of the Fittest
- Term coined by Herbert Spencer.
> [!question] What is "biological" fitness?
> > [!todo] Reproductive success. Passing genetic information on. How well an organism is suited for their environment.
- Also the Social Darwinism guy.
### Mechanisms for Natural Selection
- Four conditions needed for natural selection to occur:
	- #### Overproduction of offspring
		- Organisms can produce more offspring than the environment can support.
	- #### Heredity/Genetic Variation
		- Darwin & Wallace were experts on **temporal & spatial variations within species**.
			- Both realized that variation in traits invariably caused **differences in the ability of individuals to survive and reproduce**.
			- This natural selection depended on **variability within a population**.
				- Without variation natural selection could not occur.
			- Darwin and Wallace did not understand the underlying causes of variation since they knew nothing about genetics.
			- Mendel published his **concepts of multiple variation of "genetic" traits in 1868**.
	- #### Struggle for Existence
		-  Predator prey interactions
		- Lynx and snowshoe hair
			- Population oscillations
				- Population rises and dips.
				- A resource is present and is driving the population density of its predator.
		- Competition for resources
			- **Interspecific** between different species.
			- **Intraspecific** within one species.
	- #### Differential Survival and Reproduction
		- Organisms that are well adapted to the environment can survive and reproduce.

## Discussion of Biological Traits and Distribution
![[1.4 Evolution Through Natural Selection-3.png | 200]]
> [!question] Think about this in terms of human height. What type of distribution would we expect?
> > [!todo] A
### Genetic Variation in a Population
![[1.4 Evolution Through Natural Selection-4.png | 300]]
- There are multiple genes involved in determination of height.
	- More than 15 different chromosomal locations have been discovered that cause height variation.
### Distribution of Continuous Biological Traits
- Many continuous biological traits are **normally distributed**
	- Traits are determined by the **additive effects of many genes**, each having a small positive of negative effect on the phenotype.
- The sum of these effects causes a normal distribution of phenotypes.
- Since selection acts on different phenotypes favoring some and eliminating others, **evolutionary change cannot take place without variation.**
### Selection
![[1.4 Evolution Through Natural Selection-5.png | 400]]
- **Stabilizing Selection**
	- Intermediate forms are favored, and extremes are eliminated.
- **Directional Selection**
	- One extreme is favored.
	- This fits the finch examples for beak size/depth in relation to the environment.
- **Disruptive Selection**
	- Forms at both ends of the range of variation are favored, but intermediate forms are selected against.
