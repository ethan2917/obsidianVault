## Lecture: 2.4 Genomes and Human Genetics

## -omics (From Genomics To Next Steps)
- Determine genome sequences - (gen-omics)
- Define epigenetic elements - (epigen-omics)
- Identify all gene products - (prote-omics)
- Determine interacting molecules - (interact-omics)
- Define the function - (metabol-omics)

## DNA Sequencing
> [!question] How can we obtain the entire sequence of nucleotides in a genome?
### Sanger Sequencing Method
- Fred Sanger- English Biochemist
	- Invented DNA sequencing in 1975.
	- Nobel Prize 1980 - DNA sequencing
- Takes advantage of special **nucleotides that are missing the hydroxyl (OH) on the 3' carbon** of the sugar base.
	- Nucleotides are called **ddNTP (dideoxynucleotide triphosphates)**
	- This **blocks DNA polymerase** from adding the next base and elongating the DNA chain.

## Human Genome Project
> [!info] **Goal: Determine nucleotide sequence of all DNA in human genome. Identify the location & sequence of every human gene.**
- **1986** Crucial meeting Santa Fe
- **1988** Project launched
- **2000** 1st draft
- **2003** complete version
- Made possible by:
	- 20 research centers in **6 countries**
	- Increased computer power
	- Advances in **gene sequencing**
	- Competition between **public & private teams**
### Human Genome Project Results
![[2.4 Genomes and Human Genetics-3.png | 300]]
- **~21,000** genes in 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs.
- As many **pseudogenes** (inactivated, nonfunctional copies of genes) as functional genes.
- Only **1.5% of DNA code for proteins**.
- **Remaining 98.5% of DBA contains control regions, noncoding DNA & repetitive DNA**.

## Surprises of ENCODE Project
- 80% of genome contains elements (active RNA molecules) with biochemical function.
- 18,400 RNA genes & 20,687 protein-coding genes.
- **RNA is a major functional unit of the epigenome**
- 76% of genome transcribed to RNA not to proteins.
- **Evolution** can occur by **selection for RNA sequences that alter gene regulation**, not just selection for protein-coding sequences.

## The Genome 10k Project
- The Human Genome project led to the launch of a **new project in 2009**.
> [!info] **Goal: Sequence DNA of 10,000 vertebrates**
- Consortium of geneticists, paleontologists, ecologists, conservationists & other scientists around the world.
- 10k database **currently includes genomes of more than 16,000 vertebrate species**.

## The Roadmap Epigenomics Project: 2015
- **Roadmap** - the follow-up to **ENCODE**
- ENCODE found that **90% of DNA alterations associated with disease lie in gene switching areas** that code for the **epigenome**, not in protein coding genes.
- To find the switches and trace circuits controlling genes, researches examined 100s of cell types taken from healthy people, patients suffering from diseases, as well as fetal cells and stem cells.
- **Found millions of switches that control genes**.
### Epigenome Changes & Disease
- Central Result: it's **not single modifications** to the epigenome that matter in **causing diseases**.
- **Combinations of modifications** that cause changes in gene expression that are associated with the emergence of cancer and other diseases.
- Major difficulty relating disease to the disruption of DNA function is that **key epigenetic changes occur in poorly understood regions of the genome**.
- Identifying locations of these enhancers and the genes they affect is necessary to understand the **causal link between epigenetic changes and disease** & to designing targeted treatments.
### Epigenome Changes & Development
- **Enhancers activated through interactions with transcription factors** which bind to specific DNA sequences within the enhancer region.
- Enhancers active in epigenome areas determining cell type are enriched in DNA sequences to which cell type-determining transcription factors can bind.
- Changes in these epigenomic areas during **developmental transitions** affect cell differentiation and interactions with transcription factors.
- ENCODE uncovered **hundreds of thousands of enhancer regions** in the genome that regulate expression & development.
- Each cell type is regulated by a subset of 20,000 - 40,000 enhancers which determine its gene-expression profile.
