- All cells contain the same genotype.
- Differential gene expression leads to different cell types.
- Multiple mechanisms to regulate gene expression.
	- **DNA packing** prevents access of the DNA for transcription.
	- Eukaryotic transcription has **multiple enhancers, silencers**, and a variety of proteins that are assembled into a complex.
	- **Alternative RNA splicing** leads to multiple mRNAs for translation.
	- There are **microRNAs and RNA interference**.
	- **Translation** and **later events also regulated**.
