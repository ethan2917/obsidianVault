20 Federal agencies deal with invasive species.
Legislation:
- **1900** Lacey Act prohibits trade in wildlife, fish, and plants that have been illegally taken or sold.
- **1990** Non-indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention & Control Act
- **1996** National Invasive Species Act
- **2000** Plant Protection Act
- **2008** Injurious Wildlife Provision of the Lacey Act

There is no central program. Control is left up to municipalities and lake associations.
