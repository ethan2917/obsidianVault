![[Global Net Primary Productivity.png]]
- Highest [[Net Primary Production (NPP)]] in oceans occurs in areas with highest nutrients (N.P).
- Continental margins are most productive due to upwelling of nutrients & runoff from land.
- Open ocean tends to be nutrient poor due to limited vertical mixing.
- [[Net Primary Production (NPP)]] of terrestrial systems determined by sunlight, nutrients, temperature and moisture.
