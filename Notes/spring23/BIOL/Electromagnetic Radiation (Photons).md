![[Electromagnetic Radiation (Photons)-1.png]]
- Sun emits radiation (photons) with wavelengths 300-2800 nm.
- ~1/2 of that radiation is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, 400-700 nm.
- Other lag is mostly in the near-infrared and ultraviolet spectra.
- Plants primarily use a wavelength of 400-700 nm for photosynthesis.
