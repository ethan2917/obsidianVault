- Life & physical environment evolved together as a ***connected system*** each influencing & shaping the other.
- Species that leave the most progeny will inherit a particular environment.
- The environment that favors progeny is itself sustained and modified through [[Feedback]] from the organisms that survive & prosper in that environment.
- As a result, the biosphere became ***homeostatic***.
- Earth is like a *self maintaining [[Biotic]]/[[Abiotic]] organism* that controls its environment through positive & negative feedback mechanisms.
- [[Daisy World]]

## Summary
- An idea published by James Lovelock in 1979
- All living things on Earth function as **one** superorganism that changes its environment to create conditions that best meet its needs, with the ability to self-regulate critical systems need to sustain life.
