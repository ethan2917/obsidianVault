- **RNA interference (RNAi)** occurs when RNA molecules in combination with proteins destroy mRNA molecules before they reach the ribosomes and hence suppress the expression of associated genes.
	- For example viruses.
- **Craig Mello and Andrew Fire** received the **Nobel prize in 2006** for their discovery of "a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information".
