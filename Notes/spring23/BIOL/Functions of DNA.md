- As the "master molecule" of life, DNA must:
1. Reliably **carry the heritable information** contained in genes that enable phenotypic expression. [[Carrying Genetic Information]]
2. Be able to **replicate itself** for cell division and propagation of the species. [[Replication]]
3. Have a mechanism for translating DNA sequences into amino acid/protein sequences (a **genetic code**). [[The Genetic Code and Gene Expression]]
4. The allowance of genetic variation by random changes in genetic variation by random changes in genetic information (**mutation**) and a way to limit DNA damage (**DNA repair**). [[Mutations and Repair]]
