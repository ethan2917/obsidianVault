- STL maps store pairs of "associated" values.
- A particular instance of `map` is defined (declared) with the syntax: `std::map<key_type, value_type> var_name`
- Entries in maps are [[Pairs]]
- Map iterators refer to pairs.
- Map search, insert and erase are all very fast: *O(log n)*.
	- Python dictionaries are *O(1)*.
