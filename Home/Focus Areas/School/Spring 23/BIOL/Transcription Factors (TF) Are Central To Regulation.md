- **Transcription Factors (TF)** are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences & control the transcription of DNA to mRNA.
	- They promote or block RNA polymerase, the enzyme that copies genetic information from DNA to RNA.
- **2600 proteins** or 10% of human genome function as TFs.
- TFs are critical to the right genes being expressed in the right cells at the right time.
	- There are many TFs involved in the development of the zygote.
- Most important are the **homeodomain** proteins coded for by **homeobox genes**.
