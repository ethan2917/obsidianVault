- Diagram represents a *simplified food web*
- Many species have been left out
- "Phytoplankton" for ex = 100s of species

- This image is just a snapshot.
- Numbers, biomass & interactions amongst the species are constantly in flux.
	- As well as the physical environment in which the system is embedded.
