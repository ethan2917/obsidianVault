- In 1950, **Erwin Chargaff** reported that DNA nitrogenous base composition varies from one species to the next.
- They did not have a means to sequence DNA yet, but from chemical studies of DNA, Chargaff established two rules:
	1. The base composition of DNA varies between species.
	2. This variation depends on amount of **A = T** and **G = C** within a species
- The basis for these rules was not understood until the discovery of the DNA double helix.
