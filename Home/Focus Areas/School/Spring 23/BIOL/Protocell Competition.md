- Replication of RNA molecules within protocells creates an **osmotic gradient**, driving the cell to expand.
- As a protocell expands, membrane stretches and grans fatty acids from membranes of other protocells.
	- The "prey" protocell has lower RNA replication rates, and this a lower osmotic gradient.
