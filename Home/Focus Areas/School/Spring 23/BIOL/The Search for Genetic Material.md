- The concept of a **gene** was established by **Gregor Mendel** in the mid 19th century with his study of inheritance in pea plants.
- From him, we learned terms like **genotype**, **phenotype**, and:
	- **Gene**: A heritable characteristic (e.g., flower color)
	- **Alleles**: Variations of a gene (e.g., different colors)
	- **Dominant trait**: The trait that masks expression of a recessive allele (e.g., white flowers)
	- **Recessive trait**: The trait that is "masked" by the dominant allele (e.g. white flowers)
- In the 1920's by crossbreeding fruit flies and tracking each generation's traits and the rate at which pairs of traits were recombined. **Thomas Morgan's** group showed that genes are located on chromosomes.
- In fact. using this method they were able to *map the locations of genes in fruit fly chromosomes*.
- The two components of chromosomes, **DNA** and **protein**, became early candidates for what genetic material may be.
