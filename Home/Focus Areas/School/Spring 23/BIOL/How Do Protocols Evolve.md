- Protocells encapsulating higher amount of RNA will outcompete protocells with little or no RNA.
	- They may grow by stealing membrane from other protocells.
- RNA molecules must be replicated and mutations will generate RNAs.
- Merging with other protocells can bring RNA with other capabilities into the protocell.
