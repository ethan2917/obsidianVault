- Fred Sanger- English Biochemist
	- Invented DNA sequencing in 1975.
	- Nobel Prize 1980 - DNA sequencing
- Takes advantage of special **nucleotides that are missing the hydroxyl (OH) on the 3' carbon** of the sugar base.
	- Nucleotides are called **ddNTP (dideoxynucleotide triphosphates)**
	- This **blocks DNA polymerase** from adding the next base and elongating the DNA chain.
