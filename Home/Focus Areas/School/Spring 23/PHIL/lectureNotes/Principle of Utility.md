- The central principle of [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s theory is what he called the **Principle of Utility**.
- **Principle of Utility**: The right action or policy is whatever one will maximize the overall sum of utility, taking into account equally each person who will be affected by the action.
- Bentham equates utility with pleasure.
- In addition to being called *Classical Utilitarianism*, Bentham's theory is also classified as **Act Utilitarianism**, meaning that the right act is whichever one will maximize utility in a given situation.
	- Act Utilitarianism requires that one do a fresh *mental calculation* each time they are faced with an ethical decision.
		- A calculation as to which course of action is likely to maximize pleasure in that given instance.
[[Bentham Accepted both Psychological Hedonism and Ethical Hedonism]]
