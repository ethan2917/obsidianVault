- Franklin's X-ray crystallographic images enabled Watson and Crick to deduce the **geometry of DNA** and with the known chemical properties of nucleotides and DNA they were able to assemble a structure model of DNA.
- The X-ray images indicated the **width of the helix** and the **spacing of the nitrogenous bases**.
- The pattern was suggested that the DNA molecule was made up of **two strands** forming a **double helix**.
- Franklin had concluded that there were two outer sugar-phosphate backbones, with the **nitrogenous bases paired in the molecule's interior**.
- The only model that fits Franklin's data was one in which the backbones were **antiparallel** (their subunits run in opposite directions).
