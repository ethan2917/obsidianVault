- Central Result: it's **not single modifications** to the epigenome that matter in **causing diseases**.
- **Combinations of modifications** that cause changes in gene expression that are associated with the emergence of cancer and other diseases.
- Major difficulty relating disease to the disruption of DNA function is that **key epigenetic changes occur in poorly understood regions of the genome**.
- Identifying locations of these enhancers and the genes they affect is necessary to understand the **causal link between epigenetic changes and disease** & to designing targeted treatments.
