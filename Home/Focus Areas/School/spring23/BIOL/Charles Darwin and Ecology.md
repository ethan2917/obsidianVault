> [!quote] Look at a plant in the midst of its range. Why does it not double in numbers?...to give the plant increasing number we would have to give it some advantage over its competitors or over the animals that prey upon it -  C. Darwin, *1859*

	- The distribution and abundance of plants and animals.
	- The interactions between species such as competition and predation.
- He realized:
> [!important] Evolution is ultimately driven by the biotic and physical development of the environment...
