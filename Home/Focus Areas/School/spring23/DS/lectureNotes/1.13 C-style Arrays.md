- An array is a fixed-lengrth, consecutive sequence of objects all of the same type. The following code declares an array with space for 15 double values.
```c++
double a[15]
```
- The values are accessed through subscripting. The following code assigns a value to location i=5 of the array.
```c++
int i = 5;
a[i] = 3.14159
```
- Indexing starts at 0.
- Arrays are **FIXED** in size.
	- They do not know their own size so the programmer must keep track of the size of each array.
