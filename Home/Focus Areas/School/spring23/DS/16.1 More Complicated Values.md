```c++
map<string, vector<int> > m;
map<string, vector<int> >::iterator p;
```
- Note that the space between the is **required** otherwise `>>` is treated as an operator.
- Here's the syntax for entering the number 5 in the vector associated with the string "hello": `m[string("hello")].push_back(5);`
- Here's the syntax for accessing the size of the vector stored in the map pair referred to by map iterator p: 
```c++
p = m.find(string("hello"));
p->second.size();
```
- Now if you want to access (and change) the `i`^ith entry in this vector you can either use subscripting: `[p->second)[i] = 15;` (the parentheses are needed because of precedence) or you can use vector iterators: `vector<int>::iterator q = p->second.begin() + i;` `*q = 15;`
	- Both of these assume that at least `i+1` integers have been stored in the vector.
