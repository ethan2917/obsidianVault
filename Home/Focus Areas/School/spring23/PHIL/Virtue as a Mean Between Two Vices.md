- On Aristotle's understanding, virtue is a mean state.
- Each individual virtue is a mean between two opposed vices, a vice of deficiency and a vice of excess.
| Vice of Deficiency                 | Virtue                   | Vice of Excess                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Cowardice                          | Courage                  | Rashness, Foolhardiness                       |
| Intemperance, loses control easily | Self-control, moderation | Keeping too tight a control over oneself      |
| Stinginess, Miserliness            | Generosity               | Giving one's possession away indiscriminately |
| Living by dishonesty               | Honest, integrity        | Revealing too much?                           |
| Lack of Ambition                   | Right ambition           | Over-Ambitious                                              |
