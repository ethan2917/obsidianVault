- One criticism of [[Virtue Ethics]] is that supposedly unified virtues such as honesty or generosity are really amalgams or more specific dispositions.
	- For example, one may be generous towards family and friends but not generous towards strangers.
	- Or one might be honest with one's spouse but frequently lie to the boss at work.
- A second criticism of [[Virtue Ethics]] is that it does not give sufficient guidance for action.
> [!question] For example, what does it mean to be honest or generous in a particular circumstance?
> > [!todo] Sometimes, it seems clear, but other times there could be disagreement about which action would truly be the honest or generous one.
