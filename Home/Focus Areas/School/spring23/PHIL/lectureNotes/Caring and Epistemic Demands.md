> [!question] Again, what do you think about this? Any examples to either support or challenge the statement?
- Zagzebski argues that it's not enough to examine conscientiously the beliefs we already have within a domain that we care about, but that we also should seek to conscientiously acquire new beliefs within that domain.
- She continues: "We want beliefs that can serves as the ground of action, and that requires not only true beliefs, but confidence that the particular beliefs we are acting upon are true.".
