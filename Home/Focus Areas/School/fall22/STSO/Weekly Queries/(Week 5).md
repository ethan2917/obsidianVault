The idea that we just have to believe the science is something that has been around for ages, but what people fail to realize is that science especially in America has a very political and moral identity associated with it that distorts reality. An example of this is the policies put in place during the beginning of the Pandemic, people were not just content with believing the science and were very resilient against the rules being put into place. Even President Trump distorted the facts in spite of these policies to ensure that his followers were satisfied. To just trust the science is not a simple ideology to live by especially when there are people intentionally changing facts, will there ever be a moment in time where we all agree on one set of ideas?
