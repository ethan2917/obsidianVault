- Less than 2.4 cm of rain fell on Daphne Major in 1977, causing food resources to become scarce.
	- The smaller, softer seeds on the island were consumed first, and an alternative food source was need.
	- Larger, tougher seeds were present but finches with **smaller beaks struggled** to eat them and died off.
		- Only the larger beaked finches could easily eat these seeds and survive long enough to reproduce.
		- **Larger average beak size** followed in the years following the drought.
- Natural selection can happen very rapidly.
