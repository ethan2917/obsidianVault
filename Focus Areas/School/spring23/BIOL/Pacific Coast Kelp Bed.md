> [!question] Why did kelp ecosystems off Alaska begin to collapse in the 1990s?

- The answer revolves around the relation of the two ecosystems in the North Pacific off the coast of Alaska:
	- Orcas are predators in both ecosystem but prefer sea lions and seals over otters because of their size and fat.
	- Oceanic ecosystem:
		- Sea lions and seals eat fish and Orcas eat sea lions and seals.
	- Kelp forest:
		- Otters eat sea urchins, sea urchins eat kelp, kelp provides nursery for oceanic fish.
