| Enhancer              | DNA Sequence where transcription factors bind                                           |     |     |
| Transcription factors | Regulatory proteins that bind the enhancer and help RNA polymerase bind to the promoter |     |     |
| Promoter              | DNA sequence that RNA polymerase binds to, to initiate transcription.                   |     |     |
| RNA polymerase        | Enzyme that transcribes a gene into RNA                                                 |     |     |
