- Differences in B-hemoglobin indicate
	- How recent a common ancestor is shared among organisms
	- How closely related a group of organisms must be
	- Correlate with hereditary information
		- DNA
- The more differences, the longer since they shared a common ancestor.
- When the number of differences are similar, the pairs of organisms are likely to have shared a common ancestor at about the same time in the past.
