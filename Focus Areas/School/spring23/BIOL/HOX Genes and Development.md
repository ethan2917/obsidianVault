- Different colored strains were used to show exactly where **different HOX genes** were expressed in the **developing egg and embryo** of a fruit fly.
- As can be seen, each **HOX gene** is expressed in a specific region along the **anterior-posterior ("head-tail") axis of the body**.
- In normal **Drosophila spp.** adults, the **second thoracic segment develops a pair of wings**, and the **third thoracic segment develops a pair of modified wings called halteres**.
- For wings and halteres to develop properly, the **HOX gene, Ubx**, must be expressed with precise timing.
	- When **Ubx is artificially turned off** the fly develops a **second pair of wings** instead of halteres.
