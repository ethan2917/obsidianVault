- James Lovelock's ideas ([[The Gaia Hypothesis]]) were widely criticized.
- In response, Lovelock created the Daisy World simulation as a "proof of concept" (1983) that feedback from living organisms could regulate a planet's temperature.
- Daisy World is an Earth-like planet that is cold & barren at first, but its sun is gradually increasing in luminosity (the total amount of [[Electromagnetic Radiation (Photons)]] that it emits).
- As temp increases, life emerges in the form of black daisies.
