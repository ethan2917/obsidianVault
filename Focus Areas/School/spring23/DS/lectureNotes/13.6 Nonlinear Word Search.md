- What did we need to think about to get the details right ([[13.3 Getting the Details Right]]) when we finished the implementation of the nonlinear word search program?
- What did we worry about when writing the first draft code?
- When debugging what test cases should we be sure to try?
- Let's try to break the code and write down all of the "corner cases" we need to test.
```c++
bool search_from_loc(loc position, const vector<string>& board, const string& word, vector<loc>& path) {
	// start by adding this location to the path
	path.push_back(position);
	// BASE CASE: if the path length matches the word length, we're done!
	if (path.size() == word.size()) return true;

	// search all the places you can get to in one step
	for (int i = position.row-1; i <= position.row+1; i++){
		for (int j = position.col-1; j <= position.col+1; j++){
			// don't walk off the board though!
			if (i<0 || i>=board.size()) continue;
			if (j<0 || j>=board[0].size()) continue;
			// don't consider locations already on our path
			if (on_path(loc(i,j),path)) continue;
			// if this letter matches, recurse!
			if (word[path.size()]==board[i][j]){
				// if we find the remaining substring, we're done
				if (search_from_loc(loc(i,j),board,word,path))
					return true;
			}
		}
	}
	// We have failed to find a path from this loc, remove it from the path
	path.pop_back();
	return false;
}
```
