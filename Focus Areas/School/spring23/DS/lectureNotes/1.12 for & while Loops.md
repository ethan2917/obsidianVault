- A basic form of a **for** loop:
```c++
for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
	statement;
```
- expr1 is the initial expression executed at the start before the loop iterations begin.
- expr2 is the test applied before the beginning of each loop iteration, the loop ends when this expression evaluates to false or 0;
- expr3 is evaluated at the very end of each iteration.
- statement is the "loop body".
- Here is the basic form of a **while** loop:
```c++
while (expr)
	statment;
```
- expr is checked before entering the loop and after each iteration. If expr is false the loop finished.
