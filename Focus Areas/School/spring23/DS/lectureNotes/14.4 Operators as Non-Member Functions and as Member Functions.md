- We can write them as non-member functions.
	- When implemented as a non-member function, the expression: `z-w` is translated into: `operator- (z, w)`.
- We can also write them as member functions.
	- When implemented as a member function, the expression:`z+w`translates into: `z.operator+ (w)`.
	- This shows that `operator+` is a member function of z, since z appears on the left-hand side of the operator.
- There are several important properties of the implementation of an operator as a member function.
	- It is within the scope of class `Complex`, so private member variables can be accessed directly.
	- The member variables of z, whose member function is called, are referenced by name.
	- The member variables of w are accessed through the parameter rhs.
	- The member function is `cosnt`, which means that z will not be changed by the function.
		- Also, since w will not be changed since the argument is also marked as const.
- Both of these functions return `Complex` objects, so both must call `Complex` constructors to create these objects.
	- Calling constructors for `Complex` objects inside functions, especially member functions that work on `Complex` objects, seems counter-intuitive at first but is actually a common process.
