- Vector or a list, sorted or unsorted
	- At least one of the operations, `push` or `pop` will cost linear time.
- Binary Search Trees 
	- If we use the priority as a key, then we can use a combination of finding the minimum key and erase to implement `pop`.
	- This is the better option.
		- It may be more natural if the minimum priority value were stored at the root.
