## Lecture: 16.0 Associative Containers (Maps), Part 2

## Review of [[15.0 Associative Containers (Maps), Part 1]]
- Maps are associations between keys and values.
- Maps have fast insert, access and remove operations: *O(log n)*.
- Maps store [[pairs]]: map iterators refer to these pairs.
- The primary map member functions we discussed are `operator[]`, `find`, `insert`, and `erase`.
- The choice between maps, vectors and lists is based on naturalness, ease of programming, and efficiency of the resulting program.
