- One never achieves 100% certainty with IBE.
- The goal in IBE is to come up with an account that explains and ties together all of the observed evidence/data.
- IBE is usually the type of reasoning employed to solve crimes in detective fiction.
	- It is also used in other contexts, such as in explanations of human behavior, historical analyses of events, etc.
		- An archaeologist is investigating the disappearance of a society by looking through the dig sites to find any type of evidence to point to some sort of conclusion.
	- If a new piece of evidence is found it may dispute the original conclusion.
- If there are two or more possible explanations that cover some of your data but one explanation that covers all of your data it is more likely that the single explanation is correct.
