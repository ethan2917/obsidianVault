- Note that the premises of deductive arguments are often themselves conclusions of induction.
- Consider our earlier example of deduction:
	- All men are mortal.
	- Socrates is a man,
	- Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
- The premise that all men are mortal is itself a product of **inductive generalization** from all known instances of people who have lived in the past.
