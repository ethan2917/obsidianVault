In his article, Wetmore discusses the reasons and ways the Amish resist rapid change and technological advancement in their communities to preserve and maintain their way of life. To outsiders, these restrictions on technology may seem cruel and based upon outdated beliefs, but for the Amish, this is how their society has functioned for the past hundred years. To the Amish, the average American society is so preoccupied with technology that we often forget to enjoy life and focus on important ideals such as family and community. Yet despite how resistant the Amish become they are forced by time to adopt new technologies and sacrifice some of their values in order to live properly, compared to the Amish fifty years ago so much has changed within their communities. Will there come a time when the Amish have changed and adapted so much that they will hardly be Amish anymore? Will the rapid advancement of technology eventually force all of society to conform to one set of ideals?
