The way that scientists conduct research is one that's very important to get right, if a scientist is biased or connects with the research too much this may skew and alter their results. This is the idea that Keller brings forward in her book, she believes in the idea of looking at the object as a whole, or as she states "it recognizes difference between self and other as an opportunity for a deeper and more articulated kinship.", it is important for scientists to separate themselves from their personal ideologies when conducting any form of research. But often times this fails, especially in places like government, is there any way that politics and science can become objective from one another?
