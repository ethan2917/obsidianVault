-   2.1 Displacement, Time, and Average Velocity
    
    -   Displacement: a change in position from P1 to P2.
    -   Average Velocity: vector whose component is the change in divided by the time interval.
        -   $\Delta x = x2 - x1$
    -   $\Delta x$ is the change in quantity x. It is all one symbol.
    -   The component of average velocity, or the average x velocity, is the component of displacement, $\Delta x$ divided by the time interval $\Delta t$ during which the displacement occurs.

    -   With straight-line motion we sometimes call $\Delta x$ simply the displacement and $v \atop av-x$simply the average velocity
-   2.2 Instantaneous Velocity
    
    -   The velocity at a specific instant of time or specific point along the path.
    -   An instant has no duration.

    -   An object can have positive x and negative $v _x$ or the reverse; x tells us where the object is, while $v _x$ tells us how it’s moving.
    -   We use the term speed to denote distance traveled divided by time.
    -   Instantaneous speed, for which we use the symbol v with no subscripts, measures how fast a particle is moving; instantaneous velocity measures how fast and in what direction it’s moving.
    -   To calculate the average velocity of an object in straight-line motion, first find its displacement (final coordinate minus initial coordinate) during a time interval. Then divide by the time interval. To calculate the object’s instantaneous velocity (its average velocity over an infinitesimally short time interval), take the derivative of its position with respect to time.
-   2.3 Average and Instantaneous Acceleration
    ![[Untitled2-3.png]]
    -   Acceleration describes the rate of change of velocity with time.
    
    -   Velocity describes how an object’s position changes with time; it tells us how fast and in what direction the object moves. Acceleration describes how the velocity changes with time; it tells us how the speed and direction of motion change.
    -   To calculate the average acceleration of an object in straight-line motion, first find the change in its velocity (final velocity minus initial velocity) during a time interval. Then divide by the time interval.

    -   To calculate an object’s instantaneous acceleration (its average acceleration over an infinitesimally short time interval), take the derivative of its velocity with respect to time.

    -   Avoid the term deceleration.

-   2.4 Motion with Constant Acceleration
    -   The simplest kind of accelerated motion is straight-line motion with constant acceleration.

    -   When the x-acceleration $a_x$ is constant, the average x-acceleration $a_av-x$ for any time interval is the same as $a_x$.
    -   To find an equation for $v_x$ we first replace $a_av-x$ by $a_x$:

-   2.5 Freely Falling Objects
    
    -   The most familiar example of motion with (nearly) constant acceleration is an object falling under the influence of the earth’s gravitational attraction.
    -   Experiment shows that if the effects of the air can be ignored, Galileo is right; all objects at a particular location fall with the same downward acceleration, regardless of their size or weight.
    -   The idealized motion that results under all of these assumptions is called free fall, although it includes rising as well as falling motion.
    -   The idealized motion that results under all of these assumptions is called free fall, although it includes rising as well as falling motion.
    -   Don’t confuse speed, velocity, and acceleration in free fall Speed can never be negative; velocity can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of motion.
    -   The constant acceleration of a freely falling object is called the acceleration due to gravity, and we denote its magnitude with the letter
    -   g is always a positive number Because is the magnitude of a vector quantity, it is always a positive number.
-   2.6 Velocity and Position by Integration
    -   When $a_x$ is not constant, as is frequently the case, the equations that we derived in that section are no longer valid.
