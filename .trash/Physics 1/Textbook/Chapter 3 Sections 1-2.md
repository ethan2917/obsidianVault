# 3.1 Position and Velocity Vectors
- If the particle is at a point P at a certain instant, the position vector r-> of the particle at this instant is a vector that goes from the origin of the coordinate system to point.

- Average velocity:![[Pasted image 20220911153502.png]]
- Instantaneous velocity:![[Pasted image 20220911153543.png]]
- At any instant, the magnitude of v-> is the speed v of the partice at that instant, and the direction of v-> is the direction in which the particle is moving at that instant.

  - Average acceleration is a vector quantity in the same direction as delta v->.

# 3.3 Projectile Motion
- A projectile is any object that is given an initial velocity and then follows a path determined entirely by the effects of gravitational acceleration and air resistance.
- The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory.
- We’ll represent the projectile as a particle with an acceleration (due to gravity) that is constant in both magnitude and direction.

- Suppose that at time t=0 our particle is at the point (x0, y0) and its initial velocity at this time has components V0x and V0y The components of acceleration are , ax = 0, ay = -g.

- When air resistance isn’t negligible and has to be included, calculating the trajectory becomes a lot more complicated; the effects of air resistance depend on velocity, so the acceleration is no longer constant.
