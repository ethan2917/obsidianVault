# 4.1 Force and Interactions
- A force is a push or pull.
	- An interaction between two objects between an object and its environment.
- When a force involves direct contact between two objects such as a push or pull that you exert on an object with your hand, we call it a **contact force**.
- **Normal force** is exerted on an object by any surface with which it is in contact.
- **Friction force** exerted on an object by a surface acts *parallel* to the surface, in the direction that opooses sliding.
- The pulling force exerted by a stretched rope or cord on an boject to which its attatched is called a **tension force**.
- **Long-range forces** that act even when the objects are seperated by empty space.
- The gravitational force that the earth exerts on your body is called your **weight**.
# 4.2 Newton's First Law
- The forces that affect an object's motion are **external forces**, those forces exerted on the object by the other objects in its environment.
- The tendency of an object to keep moving once it is set in motion is called **inertia**.
- It's important to not that the *net* external force is what matters in Newton's first law.
	- For example, a physics book at rest on a horizontal table has two forces acting on it: an upward supporting force (normal force), exerted by the table and the downward force of the earth's gravity.
		- The upward push of the surface is just as great as the downward pull of gravity, so the *net* external force acting on the book is zero.

- When an object is either at rest or moving with constant velocity (in a straight line with constant speed), we say that the object is in **equilibrium**.![[Pasted image 20220914233729.png]]
## Inertial Frames of Reference
- Suppose you are in a bus that is traveling on a straight road and speeding up. If you could stand in the aisle on roller skates, you would start moving backwards relative to the bus as the bus gains speed. If the bus was going to stop instead you would start moving forward down the aisle.
	- In either case it seems as if newtons first law is not being obeyed; there is no net external force acting on you.
- A frame of reference in which Newton's first law is valid is called an inertial frame of reference.
- The earth is at least approximately an inertial frame of reference, but the bus is not.![[Pasted image 20220914235022.png]] ![[Pasted image 20220914235102.png]] ![[Pasted image 20220914235140.png]]
- If we have an inertial frame of reference , in which Newton’s first law is obeyed, then any second frame of reference B will also be inertial if it moves relative to A with constant velocity. We can prove this by using the relative-velocity relationship.![[Pasted image 20220914235335.png]]
- There is no single inertial fram of reference that is preffered over all others for formulating Newton's laws.
- If one frame is inertial, then every other frame moving relative to it with constant velocity is also inertial.
	- The state of rest and the state of motion with constant velocity are not very different; both cocur when the vector sum of forces acting on the object is zero.
# 4.3 Newton's Second Law
- Newton's first law tells us that when an object is acted on by zero net external force, the object moves with constant velocity and zero acceleration.![[Pasted image 20220915000334.png]]
- We conclude that *a net external force acting on an object causes the object to accelerate in the same direction as the net external force*.
- If the net external force is constant, then so is the magnitude of the acceleration.
- These conclusions about net external force and acceleration also apply to an object moving along a curved path.
- The net external force and acceleration are both constant in magnitude and directed toward the center of the circle. The speed of the puck is constant, so this is uniform circular motion.![[Pasted image 20220915001013.png]]
- We apply a constant horizontal force to a puck on a frictionless horizontal surface, using the spring balance with the spring stretched a constant amount. This horizontal force equals the net external force on the puck. If we change the magnitude of the net external force, the acceleration changes in the same proportion.
	- Doubling the net external force doubles the acceleration, halving the net external force halves the acceleration, and so on.
	- For any given object, the magnitude of the acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net external force acting on the object.![[Pasted image 20220915001925.png]]
## Mass and Force
- We call this ratio the *inertial mass*, or simply **mass**, of the object and denote it by m. That is, ![[Pasted image 20220915002054.png]]
- Mass is a quantitative measure of inertia.
- The SI unit of mass is **kilogram**.
- Suppose we apply a constant net external force to an object of known mass m1 and we find an acceleration of magnitude a1. We then apply the same force to another object of unknown mass m2, and we find accelerationg of magnitude a2. Then![[Pasted image 20220915003344.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20220915003400.png]]
- *For the same net external force, the ratio of the masses of two objects is the inverse of the ratio of their accelerations*.
## Stating Newton's Second Law
- Experiment shows that the *net* external force on an object is what causes that object to accelerate.
- **Newton's second law of motion:** If a net external force acts on an object, the object accelerates. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net external force. The mass of the object times the acceleration vector of the object equals the net external force vector.![[Pasted image 20220915003902.png]]
## Using Newton's Second Law
- At least four aspects of Newton's second law deserve special attention.![[Pasted image 20220915004257.png]]
	- This set of component equations is equivalent to the single vector.
- Second, the statement of Newton's second law refers to external forces.
- Newton's second law is valid in inertial frames of reference *only*, just like the first.

# 4.4 Mass and Weight
- The weight of an object is the gravitational force that the earth exerts on the object.
- Mass characterizes the *inertial* properties of an object.
- Weight, on the other hand, is a *force* exerted on an object by the pull of the earth.

## Variation of g with Location
- g = 9.80m/s2 for earth problems

# 4.5 Newton's Third Law
- Experiments show that whenever two objects interact, the two forces that they exert on each other are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.![[Pasted image 20220915224057.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20220915224125.png]]
- The two forces in an action–reaction pair act on different objects We stress that the two forces described in Newton’s third law act on different objects.
# 4.6 Free-Body Diagrams
- A free-body diagram shows the chosen object by itself, “free” of its surroundings, with vectors drawn to show the magnitudes and directions of all the forces that act on the object.
