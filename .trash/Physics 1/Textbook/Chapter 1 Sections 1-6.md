-   1.1 The Nature of Physics
    
    -   Physics is an experimental science.
-   1.2 Solving Physics Problems
    
    -   IDENTIFY the relevant concepts:
        -   Use the physical conditions stated in the problem to help you decide which physics concepts are relevant.
        -   Identify the _target variable_ of the problem - such as the quantities whose values you are trying to find for example, speed or size.
        -   Identify the known quantities, as stated or implied in the problem.
    -   SET UP the problem:
        -   Choose the equations that you’ll use to solve the problem and decide how you’ll use them.
        -   Make sure that the variables you have identified correlate exactly with those in the equations.
        -   If appropriate, draw a sketch of the situation described in the problem.
    -   EXECUTE the solution:
        -   Do the math.
        -   Used textbook worked examples to see what is involved in this step.
    -   EVALUATE your answer:
        -   Check your answer from the SOLVE step to see if it’s reasonable.
    -   Idealized models
        -   In physics a model is a simplified version of a physical system that would be too complicated to analyze in full detail.
        -   Overlook a few minor effects but not too many.
        -   The validity of our solution is limited by the validity of our model.
-   1.3 Standards and Units
    
    -   Any number that is used to describe a physical phenomenon quantitatively is called a physical quantity
        
    -   Any number that is used to describe a physical phenomenon quantitatively is called a physical quantity
        
        -   Distance
        -   Time interval
    -   When we measure a quantity, we always compare it with some reference standard.
        
        -   Such a standard defines a unit of the quantity.
    -   SI Units:
        
        -   Time - second
        -   Length - meter
        -   Mass - kilogram

-   1.4 Using and Converting Units
    
    -   An equation must always be dimensionally consistent.
    -   Always use units in calculations
    -   Converting speed units:
    
    -   Converting volume units:

-   1.5 Uncertainty and Significant Figures
    
    -   Measurements always have uncertainties.
    -   The uncertainty is also called the error because it indicates the maximum difference there is likely to be between the measured value and the true value.
    -   We often indicate the accuracy of a measured value—that is, how close it is likely to be to the true value—by writing the number, the symbol and a second number indicating the uncertainty of the measurement.
    -   We can also express accuracy in terms of the maximum likely fractional error or percent error (also called fractional uncertainty and percent uncertainty).
    -   Significant figures: The number of meaningful digits.

    -   As you work, it’s helpful to keep extra significant figures in your calculations. Once you have your final answer, round it to the correct number of significant figures. This will give you the most accurate results.
    -   When an integer or a fraction occurs in an algebraic equation, we treat that number as having no uncertainty at all.
-   1.6 Estimates and Orders of Magnitude
    
    -   Sometimes we know how to calculate a certain quantity, but we have to guess at the data we need for the calculation. Such calculations are called order-of-magnitude estimates.
