# 1.7 Vectors and Vector Addition
- When a physical quantity is described by a signle number it is called a *scalar quantity*.
- A *vector quantity* has both a *magnitude* and a direction in space.
- Displacement is a change in the position of an object.
- We always print vector symbols in boldface italic type with an arrow above them.
- We always draw a vector as a line with an arrowhead at its tip.
- If two vectors have the same direction, they are parallel. If they have the same magnitude and the same direction, they are equal, no matter where they are located in space.
