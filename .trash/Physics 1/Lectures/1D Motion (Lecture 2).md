- Variables:
    - Position x and displacement ∆x
    - Time t and time interval ∆:t
- Instantaneous or average:
    - Velocity v vavg
    - Acceleration a avg
- Constant acceleration a
- A change in position is called displacement.
    - ∆x = x - xi
- For 1 dim. linear motion
    - Position
    - Displacement (sign tells us direction)
    - ∆x = x - x0
    - Time: t
    - Time interval: (sign indicates earlier or later)
    - ∆t = t - x0
- Speed: The distance some object can move in a time unit.
    - Speed = distance move/time elapsed
- Velocity: This is a vector quantity (needs both direction and magnitude to be defined) and can be defined as the change in displacement (vector quantity) per unit time.
    - Average velocity is define as: Vavg = x-x0/t-t0 = ∆x/∆t
- Instantaneous velocity: Is the speed and direction of a moving object.
- Acceleration (a): Can be defined as the change in velocity of an object from some velocity v0 with initial position x0 at initial time to another velocity v with final position x at final time t.

- Motion with constant acceleration is important?
    - Because it means that inst. ACC. at any point and time is = the value of the average ACC. over the entire time interval.
