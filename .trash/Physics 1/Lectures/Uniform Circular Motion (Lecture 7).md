# Unifrom Circular Motion
- Definition of uniform circular motion:
	- Circular path at costant speed, 2nd law still applies, acceleration is centripetal.
## Description of Uniform Circular Motion
- **Rigid Object (or Body)**: The object (or body) in which the distance between any two points of that object (or body) remainds the same when the object (or body) is translated or rotated.
- Velocity and acceleration of a rotating object keep changing with time (even if the magnitude is constant)
# Angular Displacement and Angular Velocity
- To simplify the description of circular motion, we concentrate on *angles* instead of distances.
- **Angular Displacement**: The angle the moving point (in a circuar motion) makes as the object rotates.
- Counterclockwise rotation is **positive**.
- **The average angular velocity** is the rate of change of the angular displacement. (angular displacement change per unit time)![[Pasted image 20220922162059.png]]
- **The instant anguar velocity**: The angula velocity the object have at a particular moment, and can be given by:![[Pasted image 20220922162143.png]]
 ## Radian Measure
 - **Definition**: a measure of angle using the radius of a circular shape and the corresponding arc length.![[Pasted image 20220922162440.png]]
 - Where **r**: is the raidius of circular shape
			   **s**: is the arc the angle theta makes.
