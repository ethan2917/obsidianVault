- # Vectors
	- Position vecto and displacement vector.
	- Vector addition and subtraction.
	- Velocity and acceleration vectors.
	- Multiplying vectors:
		- Scalar product (or "dot product")
		- Vector product (or "cros product")
- #### Vector and Scalar
	- For 1D motion there are two directions and a sign tells direction. Positive and negative.
	- For 2D or 3D motions, a sign is not enough to indicate a direction. So, we need a quantity that can express both magnitude and direction.
	- **Vector:** A quantity that has both "magnitude" and "direction" postion, displacement, velocity, acceleration, etc.
	- **Scalar:**
- #### How to Express a Vector?
	1. Graphical: An arrow with magnitude and direction, denoted by a->, b->
	2. Components: A component of a vector is the projection of the vector on an axis. A vector can be expressed using these components.
	   In 2D:

		In 3D:
	3. Unit vectors: a vector that has a magnitude of 1 (unity) and points in a particluar directions.
		- They are dimensionless and only point in one direction. a^ points in the direction of a->.
		- Unity vectors i^, j^, and k^ have magnitudes of 1 and are directed in the positive direction.
- A displacement is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point P.
