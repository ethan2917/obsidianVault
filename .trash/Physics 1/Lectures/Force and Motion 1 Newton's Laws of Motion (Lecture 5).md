# Newton's Laws of Motion
- Newton worked out
	1. how to describe objects in motion
	2. a theory of gravity.
- Three "Laws" form the starting point.
# What is a Force?
- A force is produced by an interaction between two objects.
- A force always requires two objects.
	1. The target object we wish to describe.
	2. The source is the object that provides a force on the target.
- Gravity is a familiar force.
- What are the taget and source objects for the force of gravity pulling you down at this moment?
# Newton's Second Law

# Using Newton's Second Law to Solve Problems.
1. Indentify all forces acting on the object.
	-  Spring Force, Friction, Gravity, etc.
2. Choose a coordinate system.
	- If you know the direction of acceleration, choose that as one coordinate direction.
3. Draw a "Free-Body Diagram".
4. Find the components of forces acting on the object, Fx Fy Fz
5. Use Newton's second law to write one equation in each direction.
6. Solve the equation
# Free-Body Diagrams
1. Draw the object as a box or a circle detached from everything else.
2. Draw and label the force arrows acting on the object with all tails on the object.
# Newton's Third Law
- "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."
## Newton's Third Law Pairs: How to Recognize Them
- A pair of force qualifies as a Newton's Third Law Pair if (all of)
	1. They act on two different objects.
	2. They are the same type of force.
	3. Each object is a target for one force and a source for the other.
- A pair of force is not a Newton's Third Law Pair if (any of)
	1. They act on the same object.
	2. They are two different types, like normal force and gravity.
	3. They are only equal and opposite for a certain combination of accelerations and/or other conditions in the problem.
