# Normal Force (n)
- Normal force is the force acting perpendicular to the lie of connection between two objects or between and object and the surface the object sets on it.
-
# Static Frictiom Force (Fs)
- A force **holding bodies** in contact to another body or surface from start motion, this force acting parallel to the line of connection and opposing direction of motion.
- Static friction is the contact force that keeps an object "stuck" on a surface, and prevents relative motion.
## Kinetic Friction Force (Fk):
- A force acting on bodies **moving** in contact to surfaces, this force value is proportional to the normanl force and in the direction opposing the motion.![[Pasted image 20220919161824.png]]
