- Darwin & Wallace were experts on **temporal & spatial variations within species**.
	- Both realized that variation in traits invariably caused **differences in the ability of individuals to survive and reproduce**.
	- This natural selection depended on **variability within a population**.
		- Without variation natural selection could not occur.
	- Darwin and Wallace did not understand the underlying causes of variation since they knew nothing about genetics.
	- Mendel published his **concepts of multiple variation of "genetic" traits in 1868**.
